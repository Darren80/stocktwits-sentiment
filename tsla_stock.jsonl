Here’s what it will be:\n\nElon Musk is going to ask Tesla Inc.’s board of directors to change its state of incorporation from Delaware, which just invalidated Musk’s $55 billion pay package, to Texas, which loves Musk and is begging him to move and would probably let him pay himself whatever he wants. Tesla’s board is going to be like “sure yes of course, whatever you want.” Then Tesla will ask shareholders to vote to approve the relocation, as Musk has already said it will do. Some shareholders will sue Tesla, asking a Delaware court to stop Tesla from moving. They might win?\n\nIt cannot really be the case that a Delaware court can stop any Delaware corporation from moving its state of incorporation to Texas. But it might be the case that a Delaware court could stop Tesla from moving to Texas.\n\nToday the Wall Street Journal has a story previewing this news:\n\nThree powerful shareholders are trying to loosen Delaware’s long-held grip over public companies. Tripadvisor, under media executive Greg Maffei, wants to reincorporate in Nevada, over the objection of minority shareholders. Billionaire Barry Diller is awaiting a ruling that could relax Delaware’s scrutiny of transactions like the 2020 split of some of his online businesses. And Elon Musk, who reincorporated Twitter as X in Nevada last year, has said he would ask shareholders about reincorporating Tesla in Texas.\n\nThe stuff about Musk and Tesla and Texas, sure. But I want to focus on TripAdvisor, because that is the real preview of what could happen with Tesla. TripAdvisor Inc., and its parent company, Liberty Tripadvisor Holdings Inc., are Delaware public companies that are run and controlled by Greg Maffei, who has supervoting stock and does, uh, fun stuff with his voting power. He gets sued by shareholders sometimes, and apparently wanted to reincorporate his companies to Nevada to get sued less: Nevada’s corporate law seems to be friendlier to corporate officers and controlling shareholders, with “broad protections for directors and officers in many cases that Delaware wouldn’t, including involving improper personal gain,” according to the Journal.\n\nAnd the companies’ boards of directors considered moving to Nevada, and the directors decided it was a good idea, and they asked shareholders to vote to approve the move, and the shareholders approved. Well, Maffei approved, and he has supervoting shares; a majority of the independent shareholders voted against the proposals to move, but they passed anyway.\n\nBut some shareholders sued to stop Maffei from doing this. Here is their complaint. The argument is essentially:\n\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a company’s board of directors and controlling shareholder have fiduciary duties to the ordinary shareholders, and they can’t do something — even something otherwise legal, like reincorporating to Nevada — if it violates their fiduciary duties. Where the board and controlling shareholder have a conflict of interest — where they get something from a transaction at the expense of ordinary shareholders — then Delaware will review the transaction for “entire fairness”: The transaction is a breach of fiduciary duties, and so not allowed, unless the court finds that it is “entirely fair” to the ordinary shareholders. Maffei and his board of directors get something out of moving to Nevada (they get to not be sued for doing creative stuff with their control of the companies), and this comes at the expense of the ordinary shareholders (they don't get to sue if Maffei does creative stuff to them). But the ordinary shareholders were not compensated for this, and voted against it, and the board did not have a special committee of independent directors to consider the move: It just did what Maffei wanted. So the move is surely not “entirely fair” to them. So a Delaware court can and should stop TripAdvisor and Liberty TripAdvisor from moving to Nevada, so that Delaware can continue to keep an eye on Maffei for the benefit of the ordinary shareholders.\n\nAnd that kind of is how Delaware law works. In fact, this is more or less the same reasoning that a Delaware court applied last month to strike down Musk’s pay package:\n\nTesla’s directors — and Musk, who the court found is the “controlling shareholder” of Tesla even though he doesn’t own supervoting shares or a majority of the stock — have fiduciary duties to Tesla’s ordinary shareholders. Conflicted transactions need to be entirely fair to those shareholders. Musk got something out of his pay package (options worth more than $55 billion), at the expense of ordinary shareholders (who got diluted). The ordinary shareholders did actually vote to approve the pay package, but the judge found that their vote was not fully informed. And the judge found that the pay package wasn’t entirely fair to shareholders — basically, Musk wasn’t worth what he was paid — so she blocked it.\n\nAnd Maffei doesn’t really argue against this framework. Instead, his lawyers argue that there is no conflict of interest here, because Maffei and the directors want to move to Nevada for good corporate governance reasons, and they aren’t getting any personal benefits. From their motion to dismiss:\n\nPlaintiffs ask this Court to do something that has never been done before — prevent a corporation from leaving the state of Delaware notwithstanding its undisputed compliance with the provisions of the [Delaware General Corporation Law] that allow the corporation to do so. Section 266 of the DGCL gives corporations the right to leave Delaware and reorganize under the laws of another jurisdiction. Plaintiffs seek to limit that right, if not do away with it altogether. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that where, as here, a corporation decides to move from Delaware to a state that potentially provides officers and directors with greater protection from future litigation based on conduct that has not yet occurred — and thus claims that do not yet exist—the Court should enjoin the move as a breach of the directors’ (and, in this case, an alleged controller’s) fiduciary duty.\n\nBecause there’s no conflict, Maffei argues, the Delaware court should defer to the board’s business judgment rather than conduct its own review of the fairness of moving to Nevada:\n\nPlaintiffs theorize that the Directors were conflicted because there might be future board decisions that might give rise to litigation claims and such claims might survive a motion to dismiss in Delaware, but not in Nevada. As explained below, Plaintiffs’ speculation is too hypothetical and remote to constitute a unique benefit today. The Amended Complaint does not allege any existing or even inchoate litigation claim that the Conversions would extinguish. Plaintiffs’ hypothesized conflict arises from the mere possibility that the Boards might take some unidentified action in the future—after the Companies have moved to Nevada — that could give rise to a future stockholder claim. But the risk of a future unknown stockholder claim is one every board faces and is not sufficient to require entire fairness review, much less prevent a corporation from electing to move to another state. … The Amended Complaint does not contain factual allegations supporting a reasonably conceivable inference that the Directors or Maffei have a financial interest in the transaction or that Maffei would obtain some unique benefit from the Conversions.\n\nAnd that’s reasonable. But later this year, when we talk about Elon Musk moving Tesla to Texas, he won’t be able to make that argument. He will have a very very clear financial interest in the transaction: A Delaware court just struck down his $55 billion pay package, and even before that he was going around posting that he wanted another enormous stock grant so that he can control at least 25% of Tesla’s stock. And if he can’t get it in Delaware, he’ll go to Texas.\n\nI am sure that, when Tesla actually asks its shareholders to approve reincorporating in Texas, it will have good lawyers write a proxy statement emphasizing the many corporate benefits of Texas, the importance of attracting and retaining talent and the value that Musk provides to Tesla. I don’t even think that will be wrong; I think there is something odd, and perhaps shareholder-unfriendly, about a Delaware judge striking down a pay package that Tesla’s board and shareholders thought was a good idea. I just think that Elon Musk is not the most carefully lawyered guy in the world in his personal statements, and he will have made — he has already made — a very clear record proving that he wants to move to Texas so that he can make Tesla give him $75 billion worth of stock.\n\nSo shareholders will go to the Delaware judge saying “Elon Musk tried to pay himself $55 billion, and you stopped him from doing that because it was unfair to shareholders, and now he is trying to move Tesla to Texas so that he can (1) get rid of you and (2) pay himself $75 billion, so you have to stop him again.” And I think that is an argument that the Delaware judge might find compelling? I mean, she did stop Musk from paying himself $55 billion. Presumably this move will be even more offensive.\n\nAnd Tesla is a Delaware corporation, so it is subject to the orders of the Delaware court, even if those orders are “where do you think you’re going? Get back here you little scamp!” And so maybe Tesla really can’t leave?\n\nAnyway, that’s the news from six months from now, and I suppose when it actually happens I will just write some comical imagined dialogue for Musk and say “see previous column.” There are some risks to this thesis:\n\nMusk could appeal the decision about his compensation and win, and then he might lose interest in moving to Texas. I kind of think that he’ll want to move even if he wins on appeal, though.\n\nMaffei could win such a comprehensive victory in the TripAdvisor case that nobody will even be able to argue that a court can stop Musk from leaving Delaware, so Tesla will just leave with no problem.\n\nMaffei could lose so comprehensively that Musk’s lawyers will tell him “you’ve got no shot at leaving Delaware, don’t even bother,” and he’ll believe them and give that up. I assign 0% probability to this one.\n\nMoving to Texas might be a thing that Musk posts about but does not actually plan to do?\n\nI don’t know; I think it’s gonna happen. Last week Musk moved Neuralink Corp., his brain implant company, from Delaware to Nevada, and he previously moved Twitter to Nevada (and renamed it X). Those deals were easy, though: Those are private companies with smallish groups of shareholders, none of whom are all that jazzed to sue Elon Musk, so he can kind of do what he wants. Tesla is different. It does make sense that Musk would want to pursue his next idea at one of his other, private, Nevada companies. He just has a lot more control over them.\n\nI said last month that “there is something awkward about a judge second-guessing the CEO compensation decisions of the board of directors of a $600 billion company, even if, yes, it’s the board of Tesla.” But that is nothing compared to how awkward it will be for a Delaware judge to prevent the company from leaving Delaware because Musk doesn’t like Delaware judges. It seems like the world can’t really work that way, that Delaware can’t really prevent its companies from leaving. And yet … maybe? It’s gonna be a fun time here at Money Stuff when it happens.\n\nMultistrategy\n\nI wrote the other day that Bill Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square LP, “is kind of what you think of when you think of a hedge fund.” But then I realized (in a footnote) that I needed to qualify that statement. I don’t know what you think of when you think of a hedge fund. I think there are two main models. There is what I think of as the old-school classic hedge fund, like Pershing Square, where one high-profile manager makes a handful of concentrated high-conviction market bets using his natural talent and hard work and market experience and gut instinct.\n\nBut then there is the newer model of multimanager, multistrategy hedge funds, or “pod shops,” like Citadel or Millennium or Point72, that have a bunch of different portfolio managers each making bets in some particular sector or strategy. Unlike the old-school managers, the pod-shop portfolio managers don’t usually go on television that much.\n\nAlso unlike the classic funds, the pod shops are run on, as it were, scientific lines. I mean, the portfolio managers might trade on gut instinct, but they are managed scientifically. Each portfolio manager will generally be tasked with producing returns that are not correlated with the broader market or the sector she invests in: The consumer discretionary manager won’t get a bonus just because consumer discretionary stocks do well; she’ll only get paid if she buys the best consumer discretionary stocks and shorts the worst ones. She will be required to be more or less factor-neutral, to run a portfolio that makes money on the strength of her ideas rather than on broad market trends. And her bosses will have quite sophisticated techniques to measure her performance and her skill, to neutralize standard market factors and to extract only alpha, only the returns to skilled investing.\n\nThe appeal of the multimanager funds, to institutional investors, is obvious: They can offer true alpha, true uncorrelated returns. They can tell allocators: “Okay, you can get your stock-market exposure from stock index funds, your bond-market exposure from bonds, your real estate exposure from buying real estate, whatever, and then you can diversify your portfolio by putting some money into our fund and we’ll just pay you 12% per year with very little volatility.” This is not a pitch that appeals to everyone: Plenty of people want the charismatic gut-instinct-driven single manager who might put all her money on one big bet that returns 300%. But it is a pitch that appeals to sober, sensible institutional asset allocators with a lot of money.\n\n(Incidentally, one model of why Ackman is launching a public closed-end fund designed to appeal to US retail investors now is precisely that institutional investors increasingly want the scientific multimanager model, and the classic charismatic-manager model is maybe a bit outdated. But it’s still popular with retail investors on Twitter/X!)\n\nThere is, however, a downside for investors from all of this scientific management. The downside is that the multimanager funds might get too good at scientifically analyzing performance, and at attributing it to skill. The fund manager might be able to say something like “okay this portfolio returned $47 million last year, of which $13 million is attributable to the analysts’ research, $14 million to the portfolio manager’s stock-picking, $11 million to our firm’s risk management and $9 million to our investors’ capital.” And then the investors get the $9 million and the fund manager and analysts and portfolio manager get the rest. If you get too good at measuring the returns to investment skill, you might, uh, pay all of those returns to the people whose skill generated them? And what does that leave for investors?\n\nBloomberg’s Nishant Kumar and Liza Tetley report:\n\nThe priciest multistrategy hedge funds are now keeping most of the profits they generate, while clients shoulder their costs. Clients received 41 cents of every $1 made by multistrategy funds that passed on all their costs last year, according to a survey by the prime brokerage unit of BNP Paribas SA. Their share is down from 54 cents in 2021, reflecting a startling new reality where the most popular funds effectively have a blank check for expenses. These funds outperformed peers, and most of the wider industry, on investment returns. However, gains measured after fees are the lowest among multistrategy funds, the poll of 238 allocators managing or advising on $1.2 trillion in hedge fund assets found.\n\nYes, right, in the olden days a charismatic manager would take big swings on a handful of stocks and would make a lot of money. Nobody would be sure — or would even ask — how much of the returns were due to the manager’s skill and how much were just, like, the stock market went up. But the crude compromise would be that the manager paid herself 2% of assets and 20% of profits and the investors got the rest. In modern multimanager funds, the fund can say “well 59% of this performance is clearly attributable to our skill so we’re keeping it.”\n\nMeanwhile it’s not all great for the portfolio managers either. At Business Insider, Bradley Saacks reports:\n\nFormer Point72 president Doug Haynes is looking to revive a strategy he previously ran for billionaire Steve Cohen for his new fund launch. The quantamental strategy — which blends fundamental stockpicking and algorithm-based number crunching — was internally known at Point72 as Idea Lab while under Haynes and then eventually became Latitude before shuttering in 2020. … It's an alpha capture-type strategy in which 12 West Palm Beach-based analysts will come up with investment ideas, and a systematic algorithm will create a portfolio based on the ideas and analytical tools that focus on position sizing and risk management. The firm — which hopes to raise $1 billion — has \"substantial investor interest,\" according to a spokesman for the firm, and is set to launch on April 1.\n\nIf your scientific management determines that the analysts add most of the value and that the portfolio managers can just be automated away, that’s what you do.\n\nMore cell phones\n\nI guess if you ran a business and you invented some new product that you knew would prove essential to every employee of every investment bank, asset manager and other financial services firm, you might start by selling it to the big banks. The big banks have lots of money and can afford your product, winning their business will validate your product in the eyes of smaller firms, and you just get a lot of bang for your marketing buck: Big banks have thousands of employees, you probably price your product by the seat, and so you can get a lot of money by selling to a large company. But later, after you saturate that market, you will move on to other, smaller firms. Eventually you’ll get around to charging a two-person hedge fund for two copies of your product. There’s still money to be made.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission does various things, but one thing that it does these days is charge financial services firms large fees for using mobile phones. I mean, it doesn’t provide the phones or anything. But the SEC has developed a theory that it is illegal for employees of securities brokerages and investment managers to use WhatsApp or personal text messages to talk about work, and it has applied that theory retroactively to fine firms whose employees did that. And since, as far as I can tell, every single employee of every single securities brokerage and asset manager has at some point at least texted their boss to say “hey sorry I’m running late for this meeting,” the SEC can more or less fine every financial firm for doing this. It’s not exactly a flat per-seat fee, but the fines do seem to scale with the size of the firm.\n\nAnd the SEC did start with the big banks, because (1) they’ll pay the biggest fines and (2) extracting $125 million each from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, BofA Securities, etc. (and $200 million from JPMorgan) definitely validates the business model: If you run some small securities brokerage and the SEC comes to you with its hand out because you texted your colleagues, who are you to say no after Goldman paid $125 million? And then it moved on to smaller brokerages and investment banks, as well as credit rating firms, and is apparently also looking into hedge funds. The fines there are smaller — fewer employees, fewer phones, less money — but it’s a reliable business.\n\nAnd so last week:\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission [Friday] announced charges against five broker-dealers, seven dually registered broker-dealers and investment advisers, and four affiliated investment advisers for widespread and longstanding failures by the firms and their employees to maintain and preserve electronic communications.\n\nThe firms include Northwestern Mutual, Lincoln Financial, Guggenheim Securities, a bunch of others; the fines ranged from $1.25 million to $16.5 million. There is no suggestion that anyone at any of these firms used their personal phones to do crimes, just that using their personal phones to talk about business is itself illegal. They’re gonna keep going with this. Eventually I’m going to be fined $12.95 for texting a colleague about my work.\n\nBill Ackman took the FT’s ‘Bill Ackman or American Psycho?’ quiz\n\n“I got a perfect score,” he tells Reeves Wiedeman at New York Magazine, in a profile that also features “a demon child named Ackman who harvests souls for the Great Demon King.” Also quoted in this profile: “There’s a meme going around that apparently I’m causing a lot of marriages to have trouble.” And: “I am an extremely fast writer, and I am powered by a profound love that is infinite.” And: “a WhatsApp group with probably 50 billionaires.” I hope they don’t talk about work.\n\nThings happen\n\nDavid Solomon Strengthens His Grip on Goldman Sachs.

It needs as much attention from Mr. Musk as possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe is a highly talented executive and I wholeheartedly agree with him pushing back on the SEC, trying to delete days off his calendar when he needs that time.\n\n- Certainly, Eric, would love to bring you back in here. As you think about the legal aspects of all the different arguments that Elon Musk has to make in any of these appearances or any of his defenses. What is perhaps the most pressing one that he will need to make to ensure that he's still able to balance time between X and Twitter, and balance time over at Tesla as Craig was talking about earlier?\n\nERIC TALLEY Well, a couple of things. First of all, I think the antics about Elon Musk deciding when it's appropriate for him to come in front of the SEC and when it's not, that has actually proven to be more of a distraction than another four hours worth of a deposition. And quite frankly, this opinion never would have occurred had Elon Musk followed through with his entire team's plans to show up on September 15th, at which point they just decided to not show up.\n\nAnd so I think part of the challenge for Musk is just making sure that these are pretty simple rules of the road to play by. I know that he believes himself to be somewhat exceptional within them. But this is not going to be a very large issue. Probably, still won't be a very large issue.\n\nI think Tesla is the more interesting issue by a long shot and it's not just a car company, remember, it's also a solar roof company. And it's also a battery company and it's also a technology company. And there's a big question about where that next growth area is going to be.\n\nPart of the reason for the large compensation package, at least ostensibly, was to keep Mr. Musk on task and creative and putting all new growth opportunities inside Tesla. Is that going to change now depending on the outcome of this case? Does that bring about more possible litigation if Mr. Musk is perceived as funneling new ideas out of Tesla and into some of his other companies?\n\n- So Craig, to Eric's point there, when you think of Musk and his leadership, obviously, impossible to separate it from Tesla here. But even some Musk fans and some Tesla Bulls really starting to get frustrated here. Do you see ever a position where Tesla would do better without having him as CEO?\n\nCRAIG IRWIN: No. I think Musk is essential for the valuation. He's essential for the equity following of retail investors and he's been the visionary. You talk to senior executives out at Tesla, senior engineers out of Tesla and they say Musk is absolutely impossible to please. He is unstoppable. He will not take no for an answer. And that's how he's getting these tremendous results years faster than anyone else in the industry.\n\nHe's a very demanding CEO and extremely intelligent about the way he looks at some of these fundamental problems that people just assume are unsolvable or that the conventional solutions, the right solution. Musk is Tesla, that is the challenge here over the next many years. How do you backfill him? I think if Musk was gone for Tesla, the valuation would change radically in a very short period of time."}

Even mighty Tesla said its vehicle-production volume growth would be \"notably lower\" than in 2023. At 35% year-over-year growth last year, vehicle production was already lower than the 50% growth target Tesla has been aiming for.\n\nNumerous headwinds have arisen. For Tesla, it's higher interest rates (which is making financing a new car more difficult for many consumers) as well as being in the midst of a transition to new vehicle models (like Cybertruck). For automakers in general, the higher interest rate environment is pairing with their own desire to manage near-term profitability, and so some legacy automakers are choosing to prioritize hybrid vehicles alongside their newer EV models.\n\nIt all adds up to a slowing EV market for 2024. But that doesn't mean growth is washed up. In fact, there could be a top stock that could win no matter how this market shakes out: ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ: ON).\n\nOnsemi adds to the \"slowing EV market\" chorus\n\nOver the last few years, On Semiconductor (also known as \"Onsemi\") has redirected its portfolio of power management and sensor chips to automotive and industrial end markets. Automotive and industrial sales were 80% of Onsemi's $8.25 billion in 2023 revenue, up from 68% of the $8.33 billion in sales in 2022.\n\nIncluded in that total auto business was $800 million in silicon carbide (SiC) chips, a key ingredient in EV powertrains, and $1 billion in image sensors (used in advanced driver-assist systems). SiC in particular rocketed higher from about $200 million in sales in 2022 as Onsemi has reprioritized extensive portions of its manufacturing capacity to these next-gen power chips.\n\nHowever, with the EV market suddenly slowing, many of Onsemi's peers are in the midst of a slump right now due to excess inventory of some parts. Some semiconductor suppliers are forecasting a double-digit-percentage sales decline during the first couple of quarters of this year. Onsemi itself isn't immune. Fourth-quarter 2023 sales were down 4% year over year, and the outlook for the start of 2024 implies about a 5% year-over-year decline.\n\nStory continues\n\nAgain, it all comes back to the suddenly slowing consumer-demand environment for EVs, especially in those aforementioned SiC chips that help power an EV. Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury said on the earnings call:\n\n\"While market reports still project 30% or 40% growth for silicon carbide in 2024, OEM's latest EV plans indicate a more tapered growth signaling a SiC market growth in the range of 20% to 30%. We still expect to grow at 2x the market growth in 2024 with customers ramping production in both industrial and automotive.\"\n\nEV or hybrid, Onsemi wins\n\nHyperfocusing on slowing EV demand, and in particular the slowing rate of growth for SiC chips tied to EVs, misses the bigger picture. EV demand is still on the rise, just not as fast as it was in the last few years. And many automakers are also selling lots of hybrid vehicles. Onsemi's portfolio is tilted toward selling chips to both types of drivetrains. El-Khoury mentioned on the earnings call that Onsemi's 2023 chip sales to hybrid models doubled from the year prior, while actual hybrid-vehicle sales climbed just 30%.\n\nAnd as for Onsemi's sluggish revenue, do bear in mind it is once again outperforming its peers during this industry slump. That means it's taking market share. The longer-term guidance is still in force, with full-year 2027 revenue implied of at least $13 billion (up some 60% from 2023), with gross-profit margin on product sold rising to 53% (compared to 47% in 2023).\n\nThis kind of growth and profit-margin expansion can add up to a great long-term investment. It has certainly worked during the last few years.\n\nON Chart\n\nAt this juncture, Onsemi stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 16x. If a resumption of growth from the EV market, and next-gen autos in general, looks imminent in 2024, this could be a top long-term bet on the whole industry.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in ON Semiconductor right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in ON Semiconductor, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ON Semiconductor wasn’t one of them.

The All Wheel Drive Model Y also has been reduced by $1,000, to $47,990. The Model Y Performance remains unchanged at $52,490. Those are before federal tax credits of $7,500.\n\nWhile the Tesla Model Y discounts officially end after Feb. 29, it's possible that they could be extended, or made permanent. Tesla typically ramps up incentives at the end of the quarter.

Compare that to Nvidia Corp.’s 46 per cent surge or Meta Platforms Inc.’s 32 per cent gain since the beginning of the year and it’s easy to see where the questions are coming from. Indeed, Tesla is by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven index this year.\n\nArticle content The problem for the EV-maker is six of those seven companies are benefiting from the enthusiasm surrounding burgeoning artificial intelligence technology. The group hit a record 29.5 per cent weighting in the S&P 500 last week even with Tesla’s decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But despite Musk’s efforts to position his company as an AI investment, the reality is Tesla faces a unique set of challenges. “Although Elon Musk would probably disagree, investors don’t see Tesla as an AI play like most of the other Magnificent Seven stocks,” Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. LLC, said. “We have a much different backdrop for Tesla and the others in the Mag Seven: the demand trend for Tesla products is fading, while it’s exploding higher for those companies that are more associated with AI.”\n\nInvestor Canada's best source for investing news, analysis and insight.

Demand is expected to slow in 2024, and perhaps beyond, raising doubts about Tesla’s ability to grow at the rapid pace investors are accustomed to seeing. Roughly a third of the analysts covering Tesla recommend buying the stock, compared to an average of 85 per cent for the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Moreover, analysts have cut their average 2024 profit estimate for Tesla nearly in half during the past 12 months, while earnings expectations for the others have risen or stayed flat. “The challenge is that Tesla has become a one-product company, the Model Y, with every other initiative either not a meaningful contributor to revenue and earnings or still a bit of a science project,” Jeffrey Osborne, managing director at TD Cowen, said. “Being a one-product company and mismanaging the timing of product cycles can create periods of pain, which is what we are in now until the next-generation vehicle comes out next year or in 2026.” The double trouble of slowing EV demand and shaky AI credentials make it hard for investors to swallow Tesla’s sky-high valuation. Even with this year’s selloff, the stock trades at more than 60 times forward earnings. The second-most expensive Magnificent Seven stock is Nvidia Corp. at around 36 times forward earnings, while the rest trade between the low twenties and low thirties.\n\nAdvertisement 4 Story continues below\n\nArticle content “During the year, others in the Mag Seven were able to show how AI was driving real, profitable business growth,” Brian Johnson, a former auto analyst with Barclays PLC and founder of Metonic Advisors, said. “Tesla investors just got some random Optimus videos, Musk’s admission Dojo was a moon shot and yet another full-self-driving release that may be an improvement but still a long ways from robotaxi capability.” In contrast, the rest of the megacap technology companies boast of diverse and stable revenue streams, which in most cases translate into slightly slower growth, but also less volatile shares. Future bet Tesla believers say the company’s unique position as the only profitable, large-scale, pure-play EV maker earns it a seat in the elite club. Even though demand is expected to fall in the near term, experts widely expect electric cars to eventually dominate the auto industry. For anyone willing to bet on that future, Tesla is still the only real game in town, which also explains its lofty market valuation and the all-or-nothing nature of the company’s stock price — soaring 50 per cent in 2021, plunging 65 per cent in 2022 and then leaping 102 per cent in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement 5 Story continues below\n\nArticle content “I can understand traders being short-term negative on the stock,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management Inc., said. “But long-term investors are likely more positive given that no other EV maker can profitably produce the volume of units that Tesla does, in the pure EV space.” Bullish Tesla investors also point out that the company’s revenue growth beyond 2024 is expected to surpass all of the Magnificent Seven other than Nvidia. Its earnings are also projected to bounce back in 2025 after dropping this year, and will be climbing at a faster pace than most other megacaps. Recommended from Editorial Musk fails to convince Tesla investors to overlook slowdown Tesla planning new mass-market EV in mid-2025 Tesla gets a $94-billion reality check as EV winter sets in Still, Tesla’s heavy exposure to the cyclical automotive industry makes it stand out among the Magnificent Seven, particularly in light of the uncertainty around the technology of self-driving cars. Though Musk has often claimed that a future where the so-called robotaxis will be a common thing is not far off, most industry experts believe it’s still years, if not decades, away. “Tesla is one of the riskier companies we cover because the underlying business is cyclical and the autonomy piece is binary,” Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer of Spear Advisors LLC, said. “They will either crack the code on autonomy or this will drag for many years before anyone has a solution.” — With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.

Antonio Masiello/Getty Images\n\nTesla's profit margins, probably the metric most closely tracked by Wall Street analysts, narrowed to 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023. That compares with a 23.8% margin over the same period in 2022 and analysts' estimates of around 18.3%.\n\nThe group also warned that 2024 vehicle-delivery growth rates would be \"notably lower\" than 2023 levels.\n\nReports Monday, meanwhile, suggest Tesla is issuing a temporary price cut of some of its Model Y cars in the U.S., echoing similar moves in China ahead of that country's Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nMusk: 'Essential quandary of manufacturing'\n\nTesla lowered the price of its rear-wheel and long-range Model Y by $1,000, to $42,990 and $47,990 respectively, with the new prices valid until the end of this month.\n\nMusk said the cuts are an attempt to address \"the essential quandary of manufacturing: Factories need continuous production for efficiency, but consumer demand is seasonal.\"\n\nAdding to the list of potential distractions for Tesla investors is the fact that Musk, who runs at least four major enterprises beyond the carmaker, is facing a ruling from U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler, who ordered the billionaire to testify in person to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe into his $44 billion purchase of Twitter.\n\nMusk, who closed the Twitter deal in late 2022 before renaming the microblogging platform X, has thus far refused to cooperate with the SEC's investigation into whether he followed securities rules in announcing his intention to buy the social media network in the spring of that year.\n\nMusk has also made no secret of his longer-term vision for Tesla and its ability to leverage AI technologies.\n\nMusk, who currently owns around 13% of Tesla following a series of major share sales to fund his Twitter purchase in 2022, said last month that he would need to build his AI and robotics vision outside the Tesla structure unless he could acquire at least a 25% voting stake.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nTesla: Cloudy with a chance of long-term gains\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives, however, who carries an outperform rating with a $315 price target on Tesla, remains firm in his long-term conviction for the stock.\n\n\"We could not disagree more with the ultranegative Tesla narrative building and forming a black cloud over the stock,\" he said.\n\n\"While the next few months are clearly a bit cloudy for the Tesla story and overall EV demand, longer term our view is that by the end of the decade ~20% of autos will be EV with autonomous and [Full-Self-Driving] a reality and not a dream/aspiration.\" Full-Self-Driving is Tesla's premium driver-assistance system.\n\n\"We believe despite not committing to it on the [fourth quarter earnings conference call in late January], the vast majority of price cuts are now done with gradual price increases/margin expansion likely over the next six months,\" Ives added.\n\nTesla shares were marked 0.3% lower in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $193.00 each, a move that would leave the stock down more than 22% so far this year."}

As of Feb. 7, it is also the best-performing stock so far this year.\n\nAt first glance, this accomplishment sounds like Nvidia simply sustained its momentum when the calendar year flipped, which it did. But keep in mind that Nvidia, like the rest of the S&P 500, had a 0% year-to-date performance on the morning of Jan. 1. After surging by 238.9% in 2023, Nvidia is already up an additional 41.6% in 2024. Put another way, it is up 379.7% since Dec. 31, 2022.\n\nI have never seen a company the size of Nvidia follow up a banner year with such a swift and sudden spike. In fact, Nvidia is now worth more than Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway, electric vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA -2.89%), and its fellow semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices -- combined.\n\nBut for those considering adding Nvidia to their portfolios now, the real questions are whether the growth stock can continue its rally and whether it's worth buying at today's levels.\n\nNvidia's surge has been nothing short of historic\n\nThe only price move that I can think of that comes anything close to what we are seeing with Nvidia is what Tesla did in 2020, when it gained 743.4% in a single calendar year, boosting its market cap from $75.5 billion to $677.4 billion.\n\nMotley Fool Returns Market-beating stocks from our flagship service.

At the end of 2022, Nvidia had a market cap of $359.5 billion. As of Feb. 7, Nvidia's market cap is $1.73 trillion. So, in a little over 13 months, Nvidia added $1.37 trillion to its market cap, roughly double what Tesla did in a similar time.\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that Nvidia's combination of percentage gain and market cap gain is changing the market. Nvidia now accounts for 4.1% of the value of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, an ETF that mirrors the performance of the S&P 500. It's also 5% of the Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100. Every time someone buys $10,000 in an S&P 500 index fund, they are also investing $400 in Nvidia. That's a big deal, and it's contributing to making the market more tech-heavy than ever before.\n\nArrows-Out Expand NASDAQ: NVDA Nvidia Today's Change (0.08%) $0.59 Current Price $721.92 Arrow-Thin-Down YTD 1w 1m 3m 6m 1y +231.07% 5y Price VS S&P NVDA S&P Key Data Points Market Cap $1,782B Day's Range $712.50 - $746.11 52wk Range $204.21 - $746.11 Volume 51,437,603 Avg Vol 43,398,503 Gross Margin 69.85% Dividend Yield 0.02%\n\nThe pitfalls of becoming a \"story stock\"\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia's business is putting up phenomenal numbers.\n\nIts top- and bottom-line growth is extraordinary. Its operating margin is also incredibly high, as Nvidia is pocketing 46 cents in operating income from each dollar in sales. Investors think the performance will improve, as customers can't get enough of Nvidia's products to power their artificial intelligence (AI) aspirations.\n\nThe danger for Nvidia isn't how the business is doing -- it's the pressure that investors are putting on the stock. The higher Nvidia goes before the fundamentals can catch up to the valuation, the greater the risk that Nvidia becomes a \"story stock.\" With a 92.6 price-to-earnings ratio, some may argue it already is one.\n\nA story stock is a company whose valuation is based entirely on a story, or what it could become in the future rather than what it is today. Tesla did this in 2020 when it posted the incredible 743% return mentioned earlier. But Tesla largely lived up to the hype, as its revenue and bottom-line growth have been incredibly strong. Sure, the business has slowed recently. But overall, it has been an impressive period for Tesla, the company.\n\nTesla the stock, however, is actually down by more than 20% from where it traded at the end of 2020.\n\nThe stock's more recent underperformance is largely because investors were willing to pay such a high price for Tesla before it delivered its stunning results. When Tesla did that in 2021, 2022, and 2023, investors had already priced that progress in. I fear the same dynamic may play out with Nvidia.\n\nTesla is a perfect example of how a business can deliver excellent results at the same time as its stock is performing poorly, simply because the stock price previously got too far ahead of itself.\n\nA simple and relatively safe way to invest in Nvidia\n\nThe tailwinds for Nvidia and the rest of the semiconductor industry are stronger than ever. It's just that Nvidia stock is, at least for now, priced for perfection. But that doesn't mean it should be avoided altogether.\n\nThe Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG -0.71%) is well-suited for investors who feel like they've been caught flat-footed while the AI ascension has zoomed past them. Nvidia makes up 5.3% of the ETF -- a sizable position, but not enough to make or break its performance. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Tesla -- comprise over 50% of the fund.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Vanguard Growth ETF is at an all-time high, and the valuations of its top components have gotten much more expensive. But for just a 0.04% expense ratio, or 4 cents for every $100 invested, an investor can get exposure to a lot of megacap growth names, including Nvidia. It's a good way to get a starter position in Nvidia without overly committing.\n\nHit the pause button on Nvidia\n\nAt this point, I don't think investors have to fear Nvidia stock will run away from them. In many ways, its big gains are behind it; it's too late to buy Nvidia if you were looking to nearly 5x your money in a little over a year. Aside from getting limited exposure with the Vanguard Growth ETF or a similar fund, I think the best way to approach Nvidia now would be to simply hit the pause button and wait.\n\nIf the company's fundamentals have improved a year or two from now, but the stock price has languished, then Nvidia will be a far better value (and probably a strong buy). But for now, so many expectations have been pulled forward, leaving too much hot air and room for the stock to fall."}

China's BYD Auto Co., Ltd. (BYDDF) continues to make inroads into Tesla’s market share for lower-priced EV vehicles, recently overtaking the U.S. carmaker to become the world’s top electric vehicle manufacturer by the end of 2023.3 The latest price cuts will continue to pressure Tesla’s operating margin, which contracted to 8.2% in the December quarter as the company focuses on deliveries to boost sales.4\n\nTesla shares have oscillated within a descending channel over the past seven months, apart from a bull trap breakout in mid-December. More recently, buyers have defended the pattern’s lower trendline around $175, although trading volume has remained slightly below average. Looking ahead, it’s worth keeping an eye how the price responds to the channel’s upper and lower boundaries for clues on the stock’s next move. Bear in mind that the channel’s top trendline also roughly aligns with the 50- and 200-day moving averages that may provide additional resistance around the $225 to $233 region on the chart.\n\nTesla shares finished Friday's session at $193.57.

The stock doubled in 2023, but has tumbled by 25% in just the first six weeks of the new year.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why investors have been selling Tesla shares recently. Because of that drop, though, the stock was recently at its lowest level since last spring. It now makes sense to look at what sent Tesla stock falling below $200 per share, and whether this is a good opportunity for investors to buy it.\n\nBenefits of an EV growth slowdown\n\nTesla hit its electric vehicle (EV) production target in 2023, resulting in 35% growth over 2022. Most of the 1.8 million EVs delivered by Tesla were the Model Y SUV -- the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally last year. But there were signs of slowing growth in overall EV demand as the year progressed.\n\nInterest rates are one reason. During Tesla's third-quarter conference call with investors in October, CEO Elon Musk specifically noted, \"If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply can't afford it.\"\n\nFast-forward to the company's fourth-quarter call late last month, when Musk began to look at the potential gains from a cycle of interest rate cuts that many expect to start this year. \"We have lots of people who want to buy our car but simply cannot afford it,\" he said. \"And so ... as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops, then they're able to afford it and they buy the car.\"\n\nAnother advantage Tesla has gained from the deceleration in EV demand growth is that large competitors like Ford and General Motors have throttled back their EV production plans. Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors his company is rethinking its vertical integration plans for EV and battery production. Should EV demand growth reaccelerate, that will once again give Tesla an advantage on costs. That could lead to a rebound in Tesla's sinking profit margins via increases in average selling price (ASP). That would be something investors would cheer. After all, even after it repeatedly cut its vehicle prices last year, the company still generated $4.4 billion of free cash flow after spending for future growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolar and energy storage\n\nAnother thing investors may start paying closer attention to is the growth in Tesla's energy business. Its energy storage segment grew by more than 130% in 2023. That increase in deployed Megapack storage capacity and energy generation resulted in revenue of more than $6 billion last year.\n\nData source: Tesla. Chart by author.\n\nThat's a meaningful number, and on the conference call, Musk expressed optimism that growth is here to stay. \"I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted,\" he said.\n\nThe Elon Musk factor\n\nOwning any stock comes with risks. But Tesla's unpredictable CEO has brought some additional risks to the company an investment. Musk has expressed a desire to own more of the company so that he can have more control over the direction of its efforts in artificial intelligence technologies. But a shareholder recently won a lawsuit that nullified the nearly $56 billion pay package for Musk that Tesla's board approved in 2018.\n\nThat has heightened concerns surrounding Tesla's corporate governance and raised questions about the outlook for board or leadership changes. If Musk decides to focus on one of his many other major projects, the stock would likely take a hit.\n\nFor those who can stomach those added risks, though, Tesla's recent dip below $200 per share might present a tempting opportunity to gain exposure to this multifaceted EV leader. If EV growth continues, even at a slower pace than before, Tesla is positioned to be the biggest beneficiary in the coming years.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But the humiliating abandonment of Afghanistan in 2021 has been consigned with remarkable swiftness to the collective memory hole.\n\nPresumably a similar process would occur if at some future date the Ukrainian army, starved of ammunition, were overrun by its Russian adversaries. A year ago, US President Joe Biden traveled to Kyiv and told Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy: “You remind us that freedom is priceless; it’s worth fighting for as long as it takes. And that’s how long we’re going to be with you, Mr. President: for as long as it takes.” That turned out to mean, “For as long as it takes House Republicans to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy and cut off aid to Ukraine.” (McCarthy was gone by early October.)\n\nWill the news networks replay Biden’s Kyiv speech the night the Russians march into the Ukrainian capital? Or will one of them air Tucker Carlson’s next interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin?\n\nAnd how will we react if — say, later this year — we are informed that Iran has successfully built a nuclear weapon and has unleashed its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, to rain missiles down on Israel? Will we threaten to use our own nuclear weapons against Iran to save Israel from destruction, as we threatened to the Soviet Union in 1973, when it considered intervening on the Arab side in the Yom Kippur War? Or will Washington issue yet another of its warnings to Israel not to “escalate” the struggle for its own survival?\n\nOr what if we hear news that Taiwan has been blockaded by the People’s Liberation Army and that the president has decided — after carefully reviewing the considerable risk of starting World War III — not to send a naval expeditionary force to enforce freedom of navigation and supply the Taiwanese people with weapons and essential supplies?\n\nHow much attention will we devote to the end of Taiwan’s democracy and the imposition of Chinese Communist Party rule on its people? More than we pay to the next Grammy awards ceremony or Super Bowl?\n\nI fervently hope none of these grim scenarios comes to pass. However, especially when I recollect the fall of Kabul in 2021, I find it hard to dismiss the idea that we might acquiesce quite insouciantly in all three cases. And the only explanation I can find for this is that Americans, deep in their hearts, do not think that defeat applies to them.\n\nI can see why. The costs of defeat in Vietnam in 1975 were borne not by Americans but by the citizens of South Vietnam, just as the costs of defeat in Afghanistan were mostly borne by the Afghan people. The men and women who served in America’s most recent wars were a tiny fraction of the population. Those who died were long ago buried; those who suffered severe physical or mental injury are out of sight and out of mind.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is very difficult indeed to make the following argument stick: If the US allows Ukraine, Israel and/or Taiwan to be overrun by their adversaries, there will be dire consequences for Americans, too. And by “dire consequences,” I mean something considerably worse than another 9/11.\n\nRe-reading Len Deighton’s novel SS-GB reminded me that, not so very long ago, Britons could readily imagine the consequences of defeat. Published in 1978, SS-GB vividly depicts life in the UK following a successful German invasion of England in 1940. The story unfolds less than a year after the British surrender. The King is a prisoner in the Tower of London. Winston Churchill is dead, having been tried and executed in Berlin. There is a puppet government, as in France, but power is really in the hands of the German “Military Commander GB.”\n\nBorn in London in 1929, Deighton had come close enough to disaster in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz to make his depiction of Nazi-occupied London entirely plausible. Moreover, he was writing at a time when life in Britain had more than a whiff of defeat about it. Dogged by stagflation, the UK economy in the 1970s was the sick man of Europe; West Germany, by contrast, was still the land of the economic miracle.\n\nDeighton’s central character is not a hero of the Resistance, but a collaborator. Yet so sympathetically is Detective Superintendent Douglas Archer presented that the reader does not condemn him, but rather identifies with him. Archer’s wife has been killed and his home destroyed during the final defense of London. He lives with his young son in cramped and chilly lodgings. For young Douggie’s sake, life must go on and homicides must be investigated, even if that means reporting to an SS Gruppenführer: “Archer had not been a soldier. As long as the Germans let him get on with the job of catching murderers, he’d do his work as he’d always done it.”\n\nBy comparison with Robert Harris’s more ambitious Fatherland — published in 1992 and set long after a German victory — SS-GB is imbued with gritty realism. You can almost smell the soot and smog of a bombed-out, broken-down London. Deighton, who was no mean historian, convincingly depicts the interagency feuds that played out across Hitler’s Third Reich. He plausibly assumes that, with Britain vanquished, Hitler has no need to break the Nazi-Soviet Pact and invade the Soviet Union, while the US can remain neutral. And Deighton keeps the British Resistance so shadowy that its bombing of a “German-Soviet Friendship Week” ceremony at Highgate Cemetery (an inspired scene) strikes the reader as a terrorist outrage rather than an act of freedom-fighting heroism. When Archer is reluctantly drawn into the Resistance, his part in the attempt to liberate the King is a shabby fiasco.\n\nA quarter of a century has passed since I persuaded Andrew Roberts to write a chapter of the book Virtual History devoted to the historical plausibility of Deighton’s scenario. I vividly recall the cold sweat his first draft induced, with its detailed quotations from the documents in which the Germans had meticulously set out their plans for invading, defeating and occupying England. Even to us children of the 1960s, it all still seemed horribly immanent, especially the list of names of people to be arrested.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, imagining defeat can sap your morale. But it can also focus the mind on the burning imperative not to lose. Ukrainians have no difficulty imagining what defeat would mean today. They have seen the bodies strewn in the streets of Bucha after the Russian execution spree of September 2022. They know the horrors of which Putin’s colonial army is capable. Likewise, most Israelis understand only too well that victory for Hamas and its backers would be the prelude to a second Holocaust. They will never forget the hideous atrocities perpetrated last Oct. 7.\n\nBut few if any Americans think this way. It is now exactly 40 years since the release of Red Dawn, one of the few commercially successful attempts to envision a Soviet invasion of the US. Patrick Swayze plays Jed Eckert, one of a group of high school heroes who take to the hills of Colorado to fight the invaders in a succession of Rambo-esque battles. It is hard to imagine such a movie getting made today. The closest thing is Leave the World Behind, which vividly depicts the chaos into which this country would descend if all our technology — from our iPhones to our Teslas — simultaneously stopped working. Cleverly, or perhaps evasively, the film does not specify who or what is behind the cataclysmic outage.\n\nYet the American relationship to disaster movies has always struck me as rather different from the British one. Fans of Doctor Who, Britain’s longest-running science fiction series, regularly see disaster befall London. No matter how bizarre the alien invaders, there is always some allusion to the Blitz, to remind viewers that terror can indeed descend from the skies above the nation’s capital. But when Americans watched Contagion (2011), few appear to have imagined a real pandemic sweeping the land. When one arrived in the early months of 2020, I still remember the deep-seated reluctance of even well-educated people to believe that Covid-19 was something a lot more serious than seasonal influenza.\n\nWhen Americans switch on their flat-screen TVs, they seriously want to Leave the World Behind. Rather than contemplate dystopian futures, they prefer to immerse themselves in the Taylor Swift cult — a form of mass escapism that recalls the mania for screen goddesses in the isolationist 1930s.\n\nHere, then, is the movie nobody is going to make. Sometime this year, the Chinese blockade Taiwan — or maybe it’s the Philippines. Or maybe North Korea launches missile against South Korea. But let’s go with Taiwan.\n\nThe first thing that would come up in the White House Situation Room would be a request from the Taiwanese government for a US naval force to lift the blockade and restore freedom of navigation. That would need to consist of at least two aircraft carrier strike groups and a significant number of attack submarines.\n\nNow that would be possible even if it had to happen tomorrow. Only one carrier is in the Red Sea right now, the Eisenhower. The Carl Vinson and the Theodore Roosevelt are off the Philippines. The Ronald Reagan is in Japanese waters.\n\nBut before those ships could even set off for the Taiwan Strait, Wall Street would be in panic mode. Stocks would be down 20%. Apple would be down 50% (because so much of its hardware is still made in China); Nvidia too (because so many of its chips are made in Taiwan). The dollar would rally on international markets, as you would expect in any crisis, but there might well be a general bank run at home, with people lining up at the ATMs.\n\nAs in the financial crisis and the Covid pandemic, such a dash for liquidity might prompt calls for yet another round of quantitative easing and rate cuts, though Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell might fret about the inflationary risks to his cherished 2% inflation target.\n\nMatters would not get easier if China were able to attack the US carrier groups with either missiles or drone swarms. The president would also have to make a quick decision on whether to approve Japanese attacks on Chinese missile and air bases (assuming, that is, the Japanese were game). He would be reminded by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that, in the case of a shooting war, the US would run out of certain key weapons, notably long-range anti-ship missiles, within a week.\n\nAnd all this would be going on — if it happened this year — in the middle of an election, with most-likely Republican candidate Donald Trump berating Biden for either starting another “forever war” or for showing weakness by doing the opposite, while Chinese-owned TikTok would be busy persuading young Americans of the moral necessity of Taiwan’s “reunification” with the mainland.\n\nAny successful Chinese disruption of the country’s telecommunications infrastructure — as imagined in Leave the World Behind — would with high probability unleash chaos in major cities.\n\nNow all you have to imagine — after communications were restored— is Vice President Kamala Harris announcing the new policy of “Asianization” (by analogy with Vietnamization in 1969), which would mean bringing all those American troops back home. This would be followed by live coverage of President Xi Jinping’s arrival in Taipei. Finally, a week later, the foreign ministers of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea would meet in Beijing to announce the formation of the Greater Eurasian Co-prosperity Sphere.\n\nAll this may strike you as whimsical or fantastical. But it is not a great deal more outlandish than the extraordinary global upheaval that began at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. And we must remember that, for contemporaries, it was far from clear — until the success of the D-Day landings two and a half years later — that the Allies would ultimately win the war.\n\nThe interesting thing is to imagine daily life in CCP-US. At first, quite normal, aside from a lot of burnt-out inner cities and an influx of newly demobilized soldiers and sailors. Taylor Swift would probably keep singing and the Kansas City Chiefs keep playing. Only gradually would our friends from Beijing start to make their presence felt.\n\nOnly after a few months would you start to worry seriously about what you might have said in your phone calls and emails and old columns. And then you would start to delete things. And then you would have to worry that deletion didn’t really get rid of those offending words because they were backed up on the big-tech servers regardless.\n\nSome would collaborate. Some would resist. Most would acquiesce. This is how Len Deighton sets the scene in SS-GB:\n\nSome said there had not been even one clear week of sunshine since the cease-fire. It was easy to believe. Today the air was damp, and the colourless sun only just visible through the grey clouds, like an empty plate on a dirty tablecloth. And yet even a born and bred Londoner, such as Douglas Archer, could walk down Curzon Street, and with eyes half-closed, see little or no change from the previous year. The Soldatenkino sign outside the Curzon cinema was small and discreet, and only if you tried to enter the Mirabelle restaurant did a top-hatted doorman whisper that it was now used exclusively by Staff Officers from Air Fleet 8 Headquarters, across the road in the old Ministry of Education offices. And if your eyes remained half-closed you missed the signs that said “Jewish Undertaking” and effectively kept all but the boldest customers out. And in September of that year 1941, Douglas Archer, in common with most of his compatriots, was keeping his eyes half-closed.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I would loathe nothing more than to walk around New York or San Francisco with my eyes half-closed, to avoid noticing the telltale signs of CCP surveillance.\n\nBut if you don’t open your eyes — and open them wide — to the plausible scenario of defeat right now, then you run the risk of one day having to do precisely that.\n\nFerguson is also the founder of Greenmantle, an advisory firm, FourWinds Research, Hunting Tower, a venture capital partnership, and the filmmaker Chimerica Media.\n\n\n\nMore From Niall Ferguson at Bloomberg Opinion:\n\nThe US and Europe Risk Flunking Geopolitics 101\n\nHenry Kissinger Was a Complex Man for a Complex Century\n\nIn Cold War II, the US Risks Playing the Soviet Role\n\nWant more Bloomberg Opinion?

Tesla is the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year. The subhead wasn’t much better. Worse than Etsy. Worse than Boeing. Simply the worst.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, the drumbeat revolving around CEO Elon Musk’s drug use continues to grow louder. While the board’s proven to be subservient when disciplining the billionaire, it can’t allow his erratic behavior to continue.\n\nThree months ago, TSLA stock was considered a Moderate Buy (3.44 out of 5), according to Barchart.com. Today, 29 analysts cover Tesla, rating it Hold (3.28 out of 5), with a target price of $218.62, 15% higher than where it’s currently trading.\n\nIf the TSLA stock forecast is correct, Tesla can’t possibly be 2024’s worst-performing S&P 500 stock, can it?\n\nOh, it can, reminding investors that being an a**hole to virtually everyone on the planet has genuine bad karma attached to it.\n\nHere are three areas to watch that could affect the outcome.\n\nA TSLA Stock Forecast and Musk’s Wild Compensation\n\nThe billionaire’s $56 billion compensation package granted in 2018 came crashing down on Jan. 30 when Delaware judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick argued the board did little to justify its decision to give Musk a virtual blank check.\n\n“Put simply, neither the Compensation Committee nor the Board acted in the best interests of the Company when negotiating Musk’s compensation plan. In fact, there is barely any evidence of negotiations at all,” CNBC reported McCormick’s comments on her decision. “Rather than negotiate against Musk with the mindset of a third party, the Compensation Committee worked alongside him, almost as an advisory body.”\n\nIronically, the judge’s decision comes days after Musk threatened that he would take his AI ball and play somewhere else if the board didn’t give him more shares to bring his ownership up to 25%, a level he felt would ensure his various projects could remain within Tesla.\n\nI argued on Jan. 23 that Musk had already been more than fairly compensated for his efforts. He simply isn’t worth another ridiculous pay package.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, investors should pay close attention to what the board does to replace the rescinded pay package. It could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back, launching an activist showdown with the board and Musk.\n\nUltimately, this, more than anything, could alter the trajectory of TSLA stock.\n\nQuality Control Continues to Dog Tesla\n\nReuters reported at the end of December about Tesla’s quality control issues. ‘\n\nSpecifically, there were 260 complaints by Tesla owners to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2023. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and Toyota (NYSE: TM ) had 750 and 230, respectively.\n\nToyota has a 15% market share in the U.S. A big reason for that is its tremendous quality control. The low number of complaints doesn’t lie. As for GM, it had almost 3x as many complaints as Tesla. Of course, it has 21x Tesla’s market share.\n\nIt’s common knowledge that Tesla’s quality has been questionable for years. In the J.D. Power 2020 Initial Quality Study (IQS), the automotive publication ranked it last with 250 problems per 100 cars.\n\nI’ve always thought Jaguar and Land Rover had crappy quality, but Tesla takes the cake. Its problems per 100 cars was 1.5x the industry average of 166.\n\nThe Cybertruck is the most recent Tesla creation to get raked over the coals for its quality, or lack thereof. It reminds me of the Ron Howard film Gung Ho, about a Pennsylvania auto plant that gets taken over by a Japanese company. The big boss comes from Japan to tour the plant. Cars rolled off the line with no engines, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, for Tesla owners, their issues aren’t in a movie. They’re happening in real life.\n\nAnalysts Are Losing Patience With Musk\n\nDespite Tesla’s rating by analysts falling to Hold, many have remained bullish about the company and its stock. There are seven Strong Buys and two Moderate Buys compared to four Strong Sells.\n\nYou would think analysts would be more negative given X, his ridiculous compensation, quality control issues, falling market share and profits, his alleged drug use, and, let’s not forget, his racist thoughts and comments.\n\nNow, I’m not a teetotaller and believe all drugs should be legalized, but that’s not what you want from a CEO, especially one that’s prone to lash out.\n\n“In January it was reported that Musk is an occasional user of cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, and mushrooms, in addition to medical and recreational use of ketamine, and we’ve all seen him smoke weed. All of these drugs, bar the ket for which Musk has a prescription, are federally illegal, and could jeopardize his companies,” Quartz’s Feb. 5 article on his alleged drug use stated.\n\nIt goes on to say that it could be especially problematic for SpaceX, which survives off federal government contracts and looks unfavorably on drug use, etc.\n\nOn Feb. 5, Daiwa analyst Jairam Nathan downgraded Tesla stock to Hold from Buy. He lowered its target price by $50 to $195, about $5 higher than its current share price.\n\n“We see corporate governance concerns aggravating already tough financial conditions in 2024,” Barron’s reported Nathan’s comments in his report to clients.\n\nAnalysts are generally bullish until they’re not. You can see they’re losing patience. If more of those sitting on the fence with a Hold rating move to a Sell, Tesla stock could see double digits, a level it hasn’t seen since July 2020.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Does Tesla Belong in the Magnificent Seven? Does Tesla Belong in the Magnificent Seven? Play Play 4:38 WATCH: Should Tesla be in the “Magnificent 7?”\n\nAfter doubling last year, Tesla’s stock price is down 22% to start 2024. Compare that to Nvidia Corp.’s 46% surge or Meta Platforms Inc.’s 32% gain since the beginning of the year and it’s easy to see where the questions are coming from. Indeed, it’s by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven Index this year.\n\nThe problem for the EV maker is six of those seven companies are benefiting from the enthusiasm surrounding burgeoning artificial intelligence technology. The group hit a record 29.5% weighting in the S&P 500 last week even with Tesla’s decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But despite Musk’s efforts to position his company as an AI investment, the reality is Tesla faces a unique set of challenges.\n\nElon, Inc: Tesla’s Falling Stock Price (Podcast)\n\n“Although Elon Musk would probably disagree, investors don’t see Tesla as an AI play like most of the other Magnificent Seven stocks,” said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “We have a much different backdrop for Tesla and the others in the Mag Seven — the demand trend for Tesla products is fading, while it’s exploding higher for those companies that are more associated with AI.”\n\nDimming Outlook\n\nAt the heart of this divide is the dimming outlook for electric vehicles. Demand is expected to slow in 2024, and perhaps beyond, raising doubts about Tesla’s ability to grow at the rapid pace investors are accustomed to seeing.\n\nRoughly a third of the analysts covering Tesla recommend buying the stock, compared to an average of 85% for the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Moreover, analysts have cut their average 2024 profit estimate for Tesla nearly in half over the past 12 months, while earnings expectations for the others have risen or stayed flat.\n\n“The challenge is that Tesla has become a one-product company — the Model Y, with every other initiative either not a meaningful contributor to revenue and earnings or still a bit of a science project,” said Jeffrey Osborne of Cowen. “Being a one-product company and mismanaging the timing of product cycles can create periods of pain, which is what we are in now until the next generation vehicle comes out next year or in 2026.”\n\nThe double trouble of slowing EV demand and shaky AI credentials make it hard for investors to swallow Tesla’s sky high valuation. Even with this year’s selloff, the stock trades at over 60 times forward earnings. The second-most expensive Magnificent Seven stock is Nvidia Corp. at around 36 times forward earnings, while the rest trade between the low twenties and low thirties.\n\nExpand\n\n“During the year, others in the Mag Seven were able to show how AI was driving real, profitable business growth,” Brian Johnson, former auto analyst with Barclays and founder of Metonic Advisors, said in an interview. “Tesla investors just got some random Optimus videos, Musk’s admission Dojo was a moon shot and yet another full-self-driving release that may be an improvement but still a long ways from robotaxi capability.”\n\nIn contrast, the rest of the mega-cap technology companies boast of diverse and stable revenue streams, which in most cases translate into slightly slower growth, but also less volatile shares.\n\nFuture Bet\n\nTesla believers say the company’s unique position as the only profitable, large-scale, pure-play EV maker earns it a seat in the elite club. Even though demand is expected to fall in the near-term, experts widely expect electric cars to eventually come dominate the auto industry. For anyone willing to bet on that future, Tesla is still the only real game in town, which also explains its lofty market valuation and the all-or-nothing nature of the company’s stock price — soaring 50% in 2021, plunging 65% in 2022, and then leaping 102% in 2023.\n\n“I can understand traders being short-term negative on the stock,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “But long-term investors are likely more positive given that no other EV maker can profitably produce the volume of units that Tesla does, in the pure EV space.”\n\nRead more: Tesla Rakes In $9 Billion From Rivals Failing to Sell Enough EVs\n\nBullish Tesla investors also point out that the company’s revenue growth beyond 2024 is expected to surpass all of the Magnificent Seven other than Nvidia Corp. Its earnings are also projected to bounce back in 2025 after dropping this year, and will be climbing at a faster pace than most other mega-caps.\n\nStill, Tesla’s heavy exposure to the cyclical automotive industry makes it stand out among the Magnificent Seven, particularly in light of the uncertainty around the technology of self-driving cars. Though Musk has often claimed that a future where the so-called robotaxis will be a common thing is not far off, most industry experts believe it’s still years, if not decades, away.\n\n“Tesla is one of the riskier companies we cover because the underlying business is cyclical and the autonomy piece is binary,” said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer of Spear Invest. “They will either crack the code on autonomy or this will drag for many years before anyone has a solution.”"}

ARK Invest has a price target of $2,000 on the stock owing to its ability to perfect and monetize its full self-driving (FSD) software. Moreover, Wood believes the company can parlay its FSD breakthroughs into a fleet of robotaxis that could revolutionize transportation, allowing society to rethink how people and cargo move from place to place.\n\nIn any event, Wood is placing a big bet on a company with an expensive valuation.

Notably, reports surfaced alleging that Musk and the Tesla Board were involved in taking illegal drugs together.\n\nFollowing these reports, Wall Street has raised concerns regarding the potential lack of significant oversight on Musk.\n\nThe downside has seen Tesla’s stock plummet by over 22% year-to-date. As of the market close on February 9, the TSLA stock was trading at $193.57, reflecting gains of over 2% within 24 hours. It’s worth noting that the stock is attempting to recover after hitting a year-low of $182 on January 25.\n\nTesla YTD stock price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nAI predicts Tesla’s stock price\n\nWith the recent stock downturn, investors are keenly observing how the equity will likely perform for the remainder of the year. Notably, monitoring TSLA becomes more imperative as Tesla has hinted at a potential slowdown for the rest of the year.\n\nIn the Q4 2023 results, Tesla acknowledged its growth may decelerate, citing its current navigation through two major growth waves.\n\nIn line with this, Finbold consulted artificial intelligence (AI) predictions from CoinCodex to gauge where Tesla might trade by the end of 2024.\n\nAs of February 11, the data retrieved from the tool projected that TSLA is likely to trade at $232 on December 31, 2024. This projection indicates an increase of almost 20% from Tesla’s current price.\n\nTesla stock price prediction by the end of 2024. Source: CoinCodex\n\nAt the same time, according to data gathered from 34 Wall Street analysts at TipRanks, Tesla stock has some upside in the next 12 months. The projection is based on TSLA’s performance over the past three months.\n\nAccording to the analysts, the average 12-month price target is $220.26, indicating a 13.79% change from the last recorded price. The high forecast is $345, while the low forecast is $23.53. In this line, most analysts at 17 have a ‘hold’ rating on Tesla stock.\n\nTesla stock 12-month forecast. Source: TipRanks\n\nTesla fundamentals\n\nDespite implementing measures to maintain its dominance in the electric vehicle market amid intensifying competition, Tesla’s stock is grappling with bearish sentiments. Notably, in 2023, Tesla achieved a delivery milestone of 1.8 million units after implementing price reductions in crucial markets across Europe and China.\n\nThe most recent price reduction applies to Model Y cars in the U.S., extending until February 29. This comes shortly after the carmaker slashed Model Y prices in Germany.\n\nThis strategic move aimed to counter the increasing competition from Chinese players like BYD and traditional automakers. However, these price cuts have adversely impacted Tesla’s profit margins.\n\nOn a positive note, analysts forecast that Tesla is poised to retain a crucial position in the electric vehicle market, allowing the company to sustain its dominance.\n\nIn particular, Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research, anticipates that Tesla will deliver 8.4 million vehicles by 2030. This projection implies an average annual growth rate of approximately 25% over the next seven years.\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

That is more than any of the biggest names in corporate America including Tesla, the $565bn behemoth whose stock is often frenetically traded.\n\nBit Brother, which changed its name from Urban Tea in 2021 as it expanded into “blockchain-based” services, is emblematic of a trading boom taking place in some of the market’s cheapest shares. Activity in so-called “penny stocks”, whose shares are worth less than $1 each, rose to nearly 20 per cent of overall stock market volumes in December and was still 14 per cent in January, up from around 6 per cent in prior years, according to Cboe Global Markets.\n\nMuch of the activity has been driven by retail traders who got hooked on the stock market during the 2021 meme stock craze, when buying by small investors sent retailer GameStop skyrocketing.\n\nBut this time it is trading volumes, rather than share prices, that are soaring. That is due not only to the greater number of retail investors trading the stocks, but also to the growing popularity of sometimes-controversial equity fundraisings that can flood the market with new shares. The bloated share counts push up trading volumes but can weigh heavily on stock prices, particularly for lossmaking groups.\n\n“Retail tends to like these low-price stocks because they think that ‘Hey, if it only goes up a penny [then] I’ve doubled my money’,” said Larry Tabb, head of market structure research at Bloomberg Intelligence. “More than likely they buy it and it continues to go down. It’s a very dicey game.”\n\nHeavily-dilutive fundraisings, and the resulting share price falls, have helped swell the number of US-listed companies trading below $1 to 517 as of Thursday’s close, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, compared with 77 a year ago. Almost one-third of the stocks currently in this bracket have seen their share count rise by at least 50 per cent over the past year.\n\nThe result is a very different market environment from the meme stock craze of three years ago, when some retail investors made huge gains from soaring share prices as hedge fund short sellers were squeezed out of their positions.\n\n“The retail investor just sees that ‘Oh, you got $40mn of funding and you’re going to be able to increase product lines, and better revenues mean the company fundamentals will go up’,” said Mark Basile, a lawyer at The Basile Law Firm, who has used New York state usury laws to void several small-company financing deals.\n\n“The next thing you know the company is putting out good news, but the price keeps going down, and the volume of the shares being traded goes up,” he added.\n\nIn December Bit Brother sold $12mn of shares and warrants, which give holders the right to buy additional shares. If the warrants were fully exercised, the whole deal would more than double its outstanding stock count, which before the fundraising had already swelled 80 per cent in a year.\n\nAnother heavily-traded company that until recently was a penny stock is Mullen Automotive. The California-based lossmaking electric vehicle maker topped the monthly trading leaderboard five times in 2023, even as its shares plummeted 99 per cent. That came after a series of share-based fundraisings that pushed Mullen’s share count to 50 times the level of a year earlier.\n\nWhile, in value terms, trading in stocks worth less than a dollar is dwarfed by turnover of large-cap shares, the activity has nevertheless caught the attention of major exchanges and traders. Unlike other large financial centres, US trading charges and metrics such as market share are often measured by the number, not value, of the shares traded.\n\nIn January, Bit Brother was pipped to the top of the volume leaderboard by Phunware — ticker symbol PHUN — a mobile software developer known for having worked on Donald Trump’s unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign. It was worth $15mn until trading rocketed mid-month and its shares more than tripled.\n\nOn Wednesday the firm announced a $10mn capital raise through selling 40mn discounted shares. On Thursday, its shares rose 10 per cent to 37 cents, reversing a wobble following the fundraising news.\n\nSome retail investors were undeterred: “FEAR NOT #phunarmy this is the insiders and institutions trying wash out us retail investors hold strong and I’m adding on these dips,” said one poster in the stock’s Reddit forum, adding “All for PHUN and PHUN for all.”\n\nMost traded US stocks by volume December 2023 Average shares traded daily January 2024 Average shares traded daily Bit Brother 866,828,884 Phunware 276,807,790 Esports Entertainment Group 190,567,114 Bit Brother 271,221,550 Nikola 134,558,633 ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF 129,129,462 Tesla 114,775,595 Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares ETF 113,728,887 ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF 107,534,651 Tesla 111,629,224 Nxu 97,298,960 Nikola 100,248,324 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust 82,181,215 Marathon Digital Holdings 97,171,061 Marathon Digital Holdings 79,189,282 Advanced Micro Devices 93,167,142 NIO 78,275,397 SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust 80,964,599 ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF 75,661,413 ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF 77,366,809 Show fewer\n\n“We’re grateful to our retail shareholder base who helped us achieve terrific volume and brought more publicity to our company,” Mike Snavely, chief executive of Phunware, told the Financial Times. Mullen and Bit Brother did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn their hunt for financing, many tiny firms have also turned to convertible debt deals — under which they borrow from a lender who has the option of being repaid in cash or new shares.\n\nThe deals typically allow the lender to convert into shares at a time of their choosing and at a set discount to the market price. That lets them turn a quick profit by dumping their new shares, often in waves, further driving down the share price.\n\n“That’s the death spiral,” said Basile. “The funders are buying stock directly from the company and then they’re selling that stock in the market. The people who are buying it are retail traders.”\n\nTumbling stock prices mean many companies risk falling foul of restrictions imposed by major exchanges, which can remove stocks if they trade below $1 for too long. This has led a number to undertake reverse stock splits, in which, say, 100 existing shares are swapped for one new share.\n\nWhile this mechanically boosts the share price, such moves can be perceived by shareholders as a sign of weakness and the effects may only be temporary.\n\nBit Brother undertook a 1,000-for-1 split in January, removing it from the penny stock club. Since then its shares have more than halved to just under $3. Last year, Mullen Automotive conducted three reverse splits. Its shares closed on Friday at $6.97, down around 50 per cent this year.\n\nWhile the NYSE hosts some penny stocks, Nasdaq’s practice of accepting smaller and less-established companies means it is home to the vast majority. That has led to criticism it has allowed unsuitable stocks to remain on the exchange in order to retain listing fees and trading revenues.\n\n“Our rules — like any other exchange — are approved by the SEC and provide companies with specified criteria and procedures to maintain compliance,” said a Nasdaq spokesperson. “These are designed to protect investors, ensure our market operates with optimal liquidity and transparency, and allow capital formation.”\n\nLast week Bit Brother disclosed it had received a delisting notice from Nasdaq due to the exchange’s concerns about the inclusion of warrants with cashless exercise provisions in two recent fundraisings. A hearing is scheduled for later this month."}

However, the Cybertruck has not succeeded in becoming the catalyst for TSLA stock.\n\nSpecifically, the Cybertruck seems to could not have debuted at a worse time, coinciding with concerns regarding its pricing, as well as its practicality and functionality as a pickup truck due to long charging times and poor performance on snowy road conditions despite its touted four-wheeled capability.\n\nTesla stock price analysis\n\nIndeed, since November 30, 2023, the price of Tesla stock has declined from $240.07 to the present $189.56, which indicates a 21.04% drop over the last 10 weeks, albeit recording a slight recovery in the past week, during which its price increased by 2.57%, according to the data retrieved on February 9.\n\nTesla stock 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla has also issued a disappointing earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023, which the company’s biggest bull, Wedbush Securities’ Daniel Ives, referred to as a ‘train wreck,’ and which has led investors to start second-guessing the company’s prospects as an automaker.\n\nAs Ives explained in a note:\n\n“We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure, and fluctuating demand. (…) Instead, we got a high-level Tesla long-term view.”\n\nAnd nothing illustrates its lack of success better than the fact that Tesla managed to sell only one car in South Korea in January 2024 – its Model Y SUV – in what was the company’s worst month since July 2022, when it failed to sell a single EV in the entire East Asian country with 52 million people.\n\nOn top of that, the beaten-down stock is displaying negative signs in short, medium, and long-term trends, performing worse than 76% of all assets in the stock market in the last year, as well as trading in the lower part of both its 52-week range and its last-month range.\n\nOn the other hand, signs of hope include a healthy liquidity with 114.2 million shares traded per day on average and the fact that TSLA is currently outperforming 62% of the 41 stocks in the automobile industry, demonstrating the necessity of proper research before investing in any asset.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro – trusted and advanced investment platform\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this electric car maker have returned -16.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has lost 16.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nTesla is expected to post earnings of $0.69 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -18.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -27.1%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.30 points to a change of +5.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -16.3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.20 indicates a change of +27.5% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -19.7%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $25.88 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +11%. For the current and next fiscal years, $112.05 billion and $133.57 billion estimates indicate +15.8% and +19.2% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nTesla reported revenues of $25.17 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.5%. EPS of $0.71 for the same period compares with $1.19 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25.94 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.97%. The EPS surprise was -5.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, Tesla surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nTesla is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla.

Total revenue increased just 3% to $25.2 billion as high interest rates suppressed demand for electric vehicles. Additionally, non-GAAP (adjusted) net income dropped 39% to $2.5 billion as price cuts meant to stimulate demand led to material margin compression.\n\nFurthermore, while Tesla does not provide precise guidance, management did warn that volume growth could be much lower this year as it leans into its next-generation vehicle. For context, Tesla delivered 1.81 million vehicles last year (up 38%), and it produced 1.85 million vehicles (up 35%).\n\nTesla shares have declined 26% year to date due to the combination of disappointing fourth-quarter results, worrisome guidance, and allegations of drug use by CEO Elon Musk and certain board members. However, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says that narrative ultimately amounts to \"noise for the stock.\" The long-term investment thesis remains intact, and the recent drawdown creates a buying opportunity for Tesla bulls.\n\nTesla could become more profitable as it leans into artificial intelligence\n\nTesla is the market leader in battery electric vehicles, and the company has touted its once industry-leading operating margin as proof of superior manufacturing technology. Margins have since contracted as price cuts have chipped away at profitability, but Tesla is still a force to be reckoned with in the manufacturing department.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla produces battery packs (the most expensive part of an electric car) at a lower cost per kilowatt hour than its peers, and Cairn Energy Research Advisors says the company's leadership will persist through the end of the decade. Moreover, Tesla will use a new manufacturing system that could cut production costs in half to build a next-generation vehicle in late 2025. That vehicle, which may start as low as $25,000, has two implications for investors.\n\nFirst, costs associated with the production ramp will drag on profitability in the near term. Second, the low price could significantly boost demand in the long run, creating more upsell opportunities with adjacent products like full self-driving (FSD) software. Tesla already sells FSD beta subscriptions in some geographies, but the company plans to monetize the software through licensing deals and robotaxi services in the future.\n\nTesla has a strong position in the burgeoning autonomous vehicle market, given that it possesses more autonomous driving data than its peers. To elaborate, the company has a growing number of FSD-enabled cars on the road, and each one increases its ability to collect training data for the underlying artificial intelligence (AI) models. Tesla hopes to accelerate the timeline to full autonomy with Dojo, a supercomputer purpose-built for training computer vision systems, which itself could become a revenue stream in the future.\n\nUltimately, Musk believes FSD could push Tesla's gross margin to 70% in the future, up from 18.2% last year. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas is equally bullish on adjacent mobility and network services. In fact, he attributes more than half of his $500 per share price target to products like FSD software, robotaxi services, paid charging, insurance, and AI cloud services through Dojo. Jonas believes those offerings will put Tesla in front of a $10 trillion addressable market by 2030.\n\nTesla stock is difficult to value because the investment thesis is somewhat theoretical\n\nGoing forward, Grand View Research says electric vehicle sales will increase 15% annually through 2030, while the autonomous vehicle market expands at 22% annually during the same period. However, Tesla is a difficult stock to value because a sizable portion of the bull thesis is built on products that are either partially or entirely theoretical. Even Wall Street has trouble nailing down estimates.\n\nIndeed, the Wall Street consensus calls for Tesla to grow sales at 18% annually over the next five years, but that figure encompasses a wide range of estimates. For instance, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley expects Tesla to grow sales 23% annually over the next eight years. In both cases, those estimates make the present valuation of 6.7 times sales look attractive, but investors should bear in mind that AI software and services are baked into the Wall Street forecasts to varying degrees.\n\nInvestors who lack confidence in that narrative should avoid Tesla. There are plenty of other AI stocks worth buying. Alternatively, Tesla bulls should consider buying a small position in the stock today but not with the expectation of a 170% return in the near term. That is highly unlikely, given the difficult industry climate and negative sentiment surrounding the stock. But give it five to 10 years, and Tesla could produce a return of that magnitude or higher.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company failed to act on its first mover advantage in the U.S., and its market share dropping like a stone. Chinese EV makers are coming on strong, pushing Tesla out of many European and Asian driveways. It has been fraught with massive recall after massive recall. The company’s CEO is in the news for his alleged drug abuses, and his antisemitic, racist, and borderline-eugenic tweets have brought critical eyes in the direction of the electric car company. As a result, Tesla stock is going down the proverbial tubes.\n\nThe S&P 500 is performing fairly decently right now, as the index has returned 4 percent growth as a whole since January 1. This growth is buoyed double-digit percentage performance from companies like Nvidia, Meta, Chipotle, and Netflix. We’ve all seen Boeing inadvertently doing just about everything it can to sow distrust in its future, but even the airplane giant’s decline has been calm in comparison to the absolute tanking that Tesla has seen on the stock market. In just a bit over one month, the value of TSLA on the open market has declined by an incredible 24.51 percent. A quarter of the company’s value has disappeared in a month. Tesla has been kicked out of the S&P 500 club before, and it might happen again if the stock continues its downward trend.\n\n“The cost of Elon’s behavior is really hurting shareholders and it’s really unfortunate because the reason we’re holding the stock is the long-term potential of Tesla is immense,” Ross Gerber, head of the heavily Tesla invested Gerber Kawasaki wealth management company told Yahoo Finance. “In order to turn around Tesla’s stock slump, Musk needs to first correct his US$44-billion mistake—which was Twitter,” Dan Ives, the managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said in a phone interview with Bloomberg. “There’s been a brand deterioration around Musk and that’s what’s created a black cloud around Tesla,” he continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElon Musk seems to be headed for a fall, and he’s taking Tesla down with him. Shareholders are proving unwilling to stick around and see how low the company’s value will go. The company reached a high share value of $409.97 on November 4, 2021, and today it is less than half that at $189 per share. Missed earnings and revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 really hurt the company, and warnings of an even softer 2024 aren’t helping. Wall Street also sees issue with the potential unionization of Tesla employees, sending the stock further downward. With layoff fears mounting, and Musk blackmailing shareholders for a bigger slice of the pie, it doesn’t seem like investor confidence will return to $TSLA any time soon."}

RIVN shares surged 40% in December 2023 but have come back to earth to begin 2024, falling more than 30%.\n\nX\n\nHowever, while RIVN has fallen to begin the year, the EV startup announced on Feb. 5 it will launch the R2 — its smaller, cheaper, next-generation vehicle — on March 7. The new vehicle offering is expected to be priced around $40,000 and qualify for the $7,500 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit.\n\nRivian ended 2023 on a high note as interest in electric-pickup trucks appeared to be picking up following initial deliveries of the Tesla Cybertruck. At the end of December, Baird even designated RIVN as a \"best idea\" for 2024. The firm wrote that Rivian has remained supply constrained relative to demand longer than several of its EV peers. Baird added that Rivian seems well positioned for a strong 2024.\n\nHowever, RIVN shares have dropped to begin the new year. On Jan. 17, Deutsche Bank downgraded Rivian to a \"hold\" rating, from a \"buy,\" and cut its price target to 19, from 29. The firm sees downside to the company's 2024 volume and margin outlook, expecting volume guidance of 65,000 units.\n\nRivian will report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings and revenue on Feb. 21. Wall Street expects a loss of $1.35 per share, compared to a $1.73 per share loss in 2022. Analysts also predict Q4 revenue will double to $1.28 billion.\n\nOn Jan. 2, Rivian topped its own 2023 vehicle production forecast, but the electric-vehicle maker fell slightly short of Wall Street predictions for deliveries.\n\nThe company said it produced 17,541 units and delivered 13,972 vehicles in the fourth quarter. Analysts had predicted fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries growing 75% to 14,000.\n\nThe Irvine, Calif.-based company also announced that for the full year it produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122. While Rivian exceeded its own 2023 production forecast at 54,000 vehicles, Wall Street called for full-year deliveries surging 155% to 51,000 units.\n\nRivian stock plunged 10% on the announcement and fell 34.7% in January.\n\nRIVN Gets Boost From AT&T And Ford\n\nThe January decline comes after RIVN gained 40% in December, moving above key levels of resistance and clearing an aggressive entry point.\n\nOn Dec. 14, AT&T (T) announced that starting in 2024 it will begin \"piloting\" Rivian vehicles in its fleet. AT&T expects to begin adding the Rivian Commercial Van and R1 vehicles to its fleet in early 2024. It is unclear how many Rivian vehicles AT&T will order. The company partnership also sees AT&T as the exclusive provider of connectivity to all Rivian vehicles, in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nRivian had reported during its third-quarter earnings it would allow more customers beyond Amazon (AMZN), which remains a key buyer, to purchase its commercial electric vans.\n\nOn Dec. 11, news broke that Ford halved its F-150 Lightning production forecast, citing \"changing market demand\" according to a company memo obtained by Automotive News. The automaker now expects to manufacture 1,600 of the EV pickups per week at its Rogue Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Mich.\n\nMeanwhile, Rivian surprised Wall Street on Nov. 7, reporting better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and raising its EV production guidance for the full year.\n\nRivian lost $1.19 a share in Q3, less than feared, while revenue jumped 149% $1.34 billion, slightly above views. That marked the fifth straight quarter of smaller year-over-year losses, according to FactSet.\n\nRivian Stock: Tesla Cybertruck Competition Or Opportunity\n\nTesla delivered its first 12 Cybertrucks on Nov. 30. The long-awaited arrival of the new Tesla vehicle sent Rivian shares 7.6% higher the following day.\n\nThe EV giant is offering three trims of the Cybertruck, with the rear-wheel drive version starting at $60,990 with a 250 mile range. The base model will be available in 2025, according to Tesla's website.\n\nThe all-wheel drive version has a starting price of $79,990 with 340 miles of range. Tesla is also offering a top end trim, called the Cyberbeast, starting at $99,990 with a 320 mile range. Both the all-wheel drive version and the Cyberbeast have 2024 deliveries.\n\nIs Tesla Stock A Buy Or A Sell?\n\nFour years ago, Tesla announced the price would start at $39,900 with Chief Executive Elon Musk previously saying he wanted to price the base model under $50,000. Originally, Tesla and Musk stated the tri-motor Cybertruck would have 500 miles of range with the dual-motor model managing 300 miles and the base rear-wheel version getting 250 miles per charge.\n\nThe price point and the unique design language of the Cybertruck may lead more consumers to look at Rivian's offerings.\n\nBumps In the Road For Rivian\n\nThe EV startup has been on a roller-coaster ride since its initial public offering two years ago, due both to overall market conditions and execution hiccups. Meanwhile, supply-chain issues have hampered the entire industry. Rivian has also had problems of its own complicate its launch.\n\nBumps in the road have included product recalls and price increases that had to be rolled back.\n\nRivian is not likely to be profitable for a while as it continues to ramp up production. After third-quarter earnings, a number of firms lowered RIVN price targets. However, Goldman Sachs raised its price target to 25, up from 23, writing it could be more positive on the stock if it gains more conviction around Rivian's path to profitability.\n\n\"With a quarterly cash burn in the neighborhood of $1 billion and the company still nowhere near hitting the mass production rates which would achieve a more competitive cost structure, we see further difficulties ahead,\" CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson added in a note on Nov. 8 to investors.\n\nThe Road To Profitability\n\nIn September 2023, UBS initiated coverage of Rivian stock with a neutral rating and 26 price target.\n\nRivian should reach positive gross margin in 2024 but larger volumes are not expected until later this decade and an additional capital raise will be needed to support future growth, according to UBS.\n\nThe EV startup currently produces an electric pickup-truck, SUV and commercial vans. In the first half of 2023, Rivian produced 23,387 vehicles. In all of 2022, it churned out 24,337 vehicles and delivered 20,332 units. That number fell short of Rivian's stated production goal of 25,000 units for the year.\n\nRivian makes its vehicles in Normal, Ill. The plant has a production capacity of 150,000 units annually. The factory is expected to shutdown in the second quarter of 2024, with a one-week shutdown in Q4, to introduce new vehicle technology to the R1 platform.\n\nCEO RJ Scaringe has said the global semiconductor chip shortage had been the \"most painful\" constraint to ramping up production. Management also cited \"very sizable increases\" in the cost of key metals, including lithium, nickel, aluminum and cobalt.\n\n\"Increasing our production is the primary lever in our path to profitability,\" the company said earlier in 2023.\n\nRivian added in its Q3 release it expects 2023 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to be a loss of $4 billion, better than its previously expected $4.2 billion loss.\n\nThe EV startup also reduced its 2023 capital expenditures forecast to $1.1 billion, down from $1.7 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, on June 20, Rivian announced it signed a deal to use Tesla's supercharging stations beginning in 2024. Ford and General Motors along with a slew of other automakers had previously signed similar deals with Tesla.\n\nRivian Stock IPO\n\nRivian rolled out the first all-electric pickup truck, the R1T, on Sept. 14, 2021, and its R1S SUV in the fall of 2022. The company launched with great fanfare on Wall Street.\n\nOn Nov. 9, 2021, the much-anticipated RIVN IPO priced strong, an upsized 153 million shares at $78 a share — above the expected range. Rivian stock has since fallen well below its IPO price.\n\nNevertheless, Rivian had a monster IPO, raising $11.9 billion and giving the company an initial valuation of roughly $77 billion. Rivian stock soared to 179.47 on Nov. 16, 2021, then sold off sharply over the following weeks and months.\n\nAmazon Has 18% Stake In Rivian\n\nRivian is currently prioritizing production of electric vans for Amazon. The online marketplace already has around 1,000 Rivian commercial vans delivering packages in major cities in the U.S. It has ordered 100,000 of Rivian's electric vans.\n\nRivian reported in its Q3 results it has amended the exclusivity portion of its Amazon agreement allowing the company to sell commercial vans to other customers.\n\nAmazon currently has a 16.8% stake in Rivian, according to FactSet. However, Amazon is also looking elsewhere to electrify its fleet. On Jan. 5, 2022, Amazon and Stellantis (STLA) said they're partnering to develop vehicles with Amazon software in the dashboards. Stellantis will also make electric delivery vans for Amazon.\n\nRivian Stock: The EV Price War\n\nTesla and other automakers have slashed EV prices amid economic and demand concerns. On Dec. 7, reports emerged Rivian laid off around 20 members of its long-range battery cell development team, including Victor Prajapati, a former senior manager at Tesla.\n\nRivian has already been in cost-cutting mode to improve its competitive stance vis-a-vis other EV makers. In 2022, the company said it had paused plans to build electric commercial vans in Europe with Mercedes-Benz. Rivian stock fell 5% on the news.\n\nCEO Scaringe has said the company is evaluating \"growth opportunities\" and pursuing \"the best risk-adjusted returns on our capital investments.\"\n\n\"At this point in time, we believe focusing on our consumer business, as well as our existing commercial business, represent the most attractive near-term opportunities to maximize value for Rivian,\" he said in a Dec. 2022 statement.\n\nRivian has a starting price of $73,000 for its R1T electric pickup and $78,000 for the R1S SUV.\n\nAll prices are before federal tax credits. New Rivian vehicles are currently not eligible for full $7,500 EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The company's pickup truck and the SUV both meet the standards for $3,750 tax credit, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website.\n\nThe company hiked the price of its R1T electric pickup around 17% in March. That increased the base cost to about $78,975 from $67,500. The price of the R1S SUV jumped about 20%, bringing the new base price to about $84,000 from $70,000.\n\nRivian's New Vehicle Is On the Way\n\nRivian said in its third-quarter release it is continuing to \"take steps to further strengthen our balance sheet as we develop our next vehicle platform, R2, and begin long lead time equipment purchases for our plant in Georgia.\"\n\nOn Feb. 5, the EV startup is unveiling the R2 on March 7. The R2 SUV will be produced at Rivian's new Georgia factory. Production of the R2 platform is expected to begin in 2026. The R2 will be more compact and available at a lower price point.\n\n\"There's an extreme vacuum of choice we feel in the sort of $45,000 to $50,000 price range for midsize SUVs,\" Scaringe said on the Q3 earnings call, referring to Rivian's plans for its new products.\n\nRivian Stock\n\nRIVN surged nearly 8% the day after Tesla delivered its first 12 Cybertrucks, with investor interest in EV trucks picking up. Rivian stock traded above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages after gaining more than 40% in December, according to MarketSmith analysis.\n\nHowever, RIVN shares have started 2024 by tumbling more than 30%, dropping back below their 200-day and 50-day lines. The stock is currently trading about 80% below their IPO price of $78.\n\nRivian stock sank 9% on Oct. 10, 2022, after the startup recalled nearly all of its 13,000 vehicles on the road to fix a steering defect. Loosened fasteners could cause the steering controls to fail. RIVN shares also fell 9.9% on Aug. 9 after second-quarter earnings, plummeting 17% in Aug. 2023, following a three-month rally.\n\nRivian stock ranks tenth in IBD's Automakers industry group. RIVN has a 33 Composite Rating out of 99. Additionally, the stock has an 18 Relative Strength Rating and its EPS Rating is 44 out of 99.\n\nRivian sales are picking up, but heavy losses are likely to continue for some time. Shares are down more than 30% in 2024. For now, RIVN is still not yet a buy.\n\nPlease follow Kit Norton on X, formerly known as Twitter, @KitNorton for more coverage.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIs Tesla Stock A Buy Or A Sell?\n\nStocks Near A Buy Zone\n\nLearning How To Pick Great Stocks?

That would be a 1% decline vs. last year's $3.12. That was a 23% decline vs. 2022. Analyst project a solid increase in 2025 to $4.24 a share. However, Wall Street has slashed projections from $5.27 at the end of last year and $6.90 at the end of February 2023. Meanwhile, actual Tesla earnings peaked in 2022 at $4.07 a share.\n\nOn Feb. 7, Gary Black, the managing partner of the Future Fund, posted on X that with Tesla slipping to ninth in market capitalization, \"investors increasingly view TSLA as no longer part of the Magnificent 7.\"\n\n\"I find this sad, since TSLA being part of the Mag 7 was viewed as being at the top of the innovation food chain, the most glamorous of the growth stocks, America's finest,\" Black wrote.\n\nSo far in 2024, Tesla stock has retreated nearly 26%, falling below key levels of support, as the EV giant appears headed for a difficult year after CEO Elon Musk offered a tempered outlook with few specifics on Jan. 24.\n\nHowever, as analysts await news on auto gross profit margins, excluding regulatory credits, and whether vehicle pricing will stabilize, the top question for investors is always, when is it a good time to buy or sell Tesla stock.\n\nTesla Stock: Q4 Earnings\n\nWall Street slashed 2024 profit projections after Tesla reported worse-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue in late January, with longtime Tesla bull Dan Ives summing up the conference call as a \"train wreck.\"\n\nTesla reported that Q4 earnings fell 40% to 71 cents per share. Meanwhile, quarterly revenue totaled $25.17 billion, up 3.5% vs. Q4 2022. Tesla's gross profit margin came in at 17.6%, down 612 basis points. For 2023, Tesla EPS fell 23% to $3.12 while revenue increased 19% to $96.77 billion.\n\nIn 2024, Tesla's \"vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023 \"as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas,\" according to the company.\n\nTesla said it is also \"currently between two major growth waves,\" with the \"global expansion\" of the Model 3 and Model Y vehicle platform \"and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform.\"\n\n\"There's lots to look forward to in 2024,\" Musk said on the earnings call. He added that Tesla is focused on ensuring that its next-generation vehicle, energy storage, full self driving and \"other projects\" are \"executed as well as possible.\"\n\nHowever, without any specifics and no word on its vehicle price cutting strategy or what way profit margins are expected to go in 2024, Wall Street has cut profit expectations. Many Tesla bulls have also turned bearish on the short-term outlook for TSLA.\n\nTesla Stock No Longer A 'Best Idea'\n\nWedbush Securities removed Tesla stock from its list of \"best ideas\" for 2024 following earnings as Ives outlined a number of items Tesla and CEO Elon Musk must address for TSLA to recover.\n\nWedbush analyst Ives said that TSLA will remain off the firm's list of best ideas until there is evidence that Musk and the company takes up their suggestions.\n\nIves wrote a list of 10 items for \"Musk to turn Tesla around.\" The firm's asks include Tesla to announce a $10 billion share buyback program, to create a holding structure for AI initiatives and give Musk more control, stop vehicle price cuts to maintain margin leverage over other automakers, get assurance Musk will not do more TSLA stock sales to fund X, and to give a \"hittable\" production and delivery timeline for Model 2 and sub $30k vehicle in 2025.\n\nIves, who has been one of the most bullish supporters of Tesla, cut his Tesla price target to 315, down from 350.\n\nAnalysts Voice Tesla Concerns\n\n\"We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure and fluctuating demand,\" Ives wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, another Tesla bull, wrote that the 2024 outlook was the \"least detailed we remember.\" He added that Tesla profitability could drop toward the $2 per share level.\n\n\"Investors and analysts are very much 'on their own' when it comes to the FY2024 revenue and growth outlook,\" Jonas wrote.\n\nBernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi noted in late January that 2024 will be a challenging year for Tesla and that it is becoming \"increasingly apparent that 2025 will likely not be better.\"\n\nQ4 Earnings Overshadow Record Deliveries\n\nThe company delivered 461,538 Model 3/Y vehicles in Q4 and 22,969 \"other models.\" Tesla currently produces the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and Cybertruck.\n\nTesla's previous quarterly delivery record was in Q2 with 466,140. In Q3, TSLA delivered 435,059 units.\n\nTesla had been aiming to deliver 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. Ahead of Tesla's data release, Wall Street consensus had Tesla vehicle deliveries in 2023 totaling 1.797 million, just below that 1.8 million target, according to FactSet.\n\nCybertruck Event\n\nThe pessimism at the end of 2023 followed the excitement surrounding the Nov. 30 Cybertruck event.\n\nTesla delivered 12 Cybertrucks at its Austin, Texas, factory with pomp and circumstance.\n\n\"We have a car here that experts said was impossible, that experts said would never be made,\" Chief Executive Elon Musk told the crowd.\n\nThe EV giant is offering three trims of the Cybertruck, with the rear-wheel drive version starting at $60,990 with a 250 mile range. The base model will be available in 2025, according to Tesla's website.\n\nThe all-wheel drive version has a starting price of $79,990 with 340 miles of range. Tesla is also offering a top end trim, called the Cyberbeast, starting at $99,990 with a 320 mile range. Both the all-wheel drive version and the Cyberbeast have 2024 deliveries.\n\nFour years ago, Tesla announced the price would start at $39,900.\n\nTesla Stock Falls Amid Growth Concerns\n\nTSLA shares sank after the company announced worse-than-expected Q3 earnings and revenue on October 18, 2023. Tesla reported third-quarter earnings down 37% to 66 cents per share, the lowest in two years for Chief Executive Elon Musk.\n\nMeanwhile, quarterly revenue increased 9% to $23.35 billion. Tesla's auto gross profit margins, excluding regulatory credits, fell to 16.3%. Auto gross margins came in at 18.1% in Q2, down from 19% in Q1. That is below the 20% gross margin \"floor\" Tesla previously targeted.\n\nElon Musk on the earnings call also preached caution, offering investors warnings about the Cybertruck and the broader economy. The following day, Tesla stock fell 9.3%.\n\nMusk said it will take 12-18 months before the Cybertruck is a \"significant positive cash flow contributor.\" He added there will be \"enormous challenges\" in reaching volume production.\n\nMusk has said Tesla will end up producing around 250,000 Cybertruck units per year, reaching that output sometime in 2025.\n\nTesla Stock And Musk\n\nThere is never a dull moment for Tesla and Musk, with the two inextricably linked. After Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 28, 2022 purchasing the social media platform for $44 billion, some longtime Tesla stock bulls worried Musk's focus on Twitter, along with negative attention, would weigh down Tesla stock.\n\nMusk appeared to lessen those fears when he hired Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal's advertising chief, as the new CEO for X Corp., formerly known as Twitter. The Tesla chief added Yaccarino will focus on business operations while he will work on product design and new technology.\n\nAt the time, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote the news ends some of the \"distraction risk around the Tesla story.\"\n\nHowever, Tesla stock cut back below a key technical level early on Nov. 16, following a four-day, almost 18% rally. The pullback also came after comments made on X by Chief Executive Elon Musk in support of an antisemitic post.\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk on Jan. 15 posted on X that he feels he needs more TSLA shares and voting power before making the EV giant an AI and robotics leader.\n\nMusk wrote that he's \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.\" The chief executive added that he wants enough shares to be \"influential but not so much that I can't be overturned.\"\n\nOn Feb. 3, the Wall Street Journal reported that some Tesla board members felt pressure to do drugs with Elon Musk. The in-depth report said some friends have urged him to go to rehab, and highlighted concerns that the board is not sufficiently independent from Musk.\n\nTesla's Global Price Cutting Strategy\n\nTo maintain sales momentum in 2023, Tesla aggressively cut vehicle prices and offered discounts throughout the year. Auto gross margins, which peaked at 30% in Q4 2021 amid industry chip shortages, have plunged well below 20%.\n\nTesla has continued cutting prices early in 2024, deciding in January to trim China vehicle prices on the Model 3 and two Model Y variants and slashing Model Y prices in many European countries.\n\nOn Feb. 4, the EV giant raised the U.S. price of its Model 3 Long Range variant. The Model 3 LR price is now $46,990, an increase of $1,000. Tesla kept the U.S. price of its Rear-Wheel Drive version at $38,990.\n\nThe price hike may reflect strong demand for the upgraded \"Highland\" Model 3 or simply limited supply. Model 3 production is down significantly in the first quarter as the Fremont plant switched over to the Highland model.\n\nTesla Vehicle Price Inversion\n\nTesla's latest move further inverts prices between the Model 3 and Model Y, with the latter traditionally more expensive.\n\nThe Model Y RWD is $43,990, with the Long Range variant $48,990 and the Performance variant is $52,490. But the Model Y is eligible for the IRA tax credit of $7,500, so customers actually pay $36,490, $41,490 or $44,990 for the Model Y.\n\nTesla on Feb. 4 also allowed a free transfer of Full Self-Driving (FSD) in North America for FSD owners who take delivery of new eligible EVs by March 31.\n\nOn Jan 17, Gary Black posted on X that based on the January price cuts he was revising 2024 earnings estimates to $3.75 per share, down from $3.90 per share.\n\nBlack added that Tesla management \"still does not see that cutting configurator prices and inventory discounts by the same amount is value destructive.\"\n\nHertz Signals Waning EV Demand?\n\nOn Jan. 11, Tesla stock traded below its 200-day moving average for the first since late November as Hertz (HTZ) announced it is selling about one-third of its EV fleet and that it predicts $245 million of incremental depreciation expenses related to the sale in the fourth quarter.\n\nHertz reported it will sell around 20,000 electric vehicles and that it expects to reinvest a portion of the proceeds from the sales into the purchase of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to meet customer demand. In 2021, Hertz ordered 100,000 Tesla vehicles, with the goal to convert around 20% of its global fleet to EVs.\n\nTesla Momentum, Competition In China\n\nTesla ended 2023 with sales momentum in China. However, the EV dynamic in China could quickly change. Musk has said China's EV companies are Tesla's main competition — with BYD (BYDDF), Nio (NIO), Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO) and others all making inroads in the EV market.\n\nBYD, already far above Tesla EV sales including plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), overtook its U.S. rival in global BEV deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023. Warren Buffett-backed BYD has also decided to open a plant in Europe, moving onto Tesla's turf on another continent. BYD already is building plants in Thailand and Brazil.\n\nTesla is reportedly planning to revamp the Model Y in China with mass production beginning as early as mid-2024, according to Bloomberg. This comes after it launched a new Model 3 with a modest refresh.\n\nBut will that be enough? Chinese EV makers keep cutting prices and stepping up vehicle quality and specs.\n\nTesla EVs In Regulators' Sights\n\nEntering 2024, Tesla faces mounting pressure from regulators. A recent Reuters investigation found the EV giant has known of faulty suspension and steering parts across its model lineup going back at least seven years, but often blamed drivers when those parts failed.\n\nNorway's traffic safety regulator recently confirmed that it's been investigating suspension failures in Model S and X vehicles since September 2022. A resolution is expected soon, with a recall possible.\n\nSweden announced on December 22, 2023 that it's also looking into similar issues. The Reuters report could bolster regulators' probes and provide fodder for class-action lawsuits.\n\nThis comes after a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation recently spurred Tesla to perform an over-the-air software \"recall\" on more than 2 million vehicles after determining that the Autopilot is prone to misuse after reviewing 1,000 accidents.\n\nThe NHTSA's Autopilot safety probe is ongoing.\n\nNext-Generation Electric Vehicle On The Way?\n\nMeanwhile, Musk and Tesla appear to be focusing on the $25,000 next-generation electric vehicle.\n\nReuters reported ahead of Q4 earnings that Tesla has told suppliers it wants to begin production of a new mass market vehicle, code-named \"Redwood,\" in mid-2025.\n\n\"We're very far along on our next generation low cost vehicle,\" Musk said on the Q4 earnings call.\n\nMusk added Wednesday that Tesla is currently looking to start production sometime in the second half of 2025. However, Musk cautioned his words should be \"taken with a grain of salt.\"\n\nThroughout 2023, Tesla said it continued to \"make progress\" on its next-generation platform. The EV company has remained mostly silent on details about the vehicle. At the annual shareholder meeting last spring, Tesla teased a vehicle silhouette.\n\nMusk confirmed on Jan. 24 that the first production line for the next-generation Tesla vehicle will be at its Texas facility. Tesla originally said the new vehicle would first be produced in Mexico, but that proposed plant is on the back burner.\n\nHowever, it's unclear when the next-generation vehicle would begin deliveries. Musk has promised \"revolutionary\" manufacturing to cut costs, but that could take a long time to develop.\n\nAlso, it's unclear if Tesla's next-gen EV will be eligible for tax credits, depending on its battery sourcing. The Model 3 is no longer eligible for IRA credits of $7,500.\n\nIs Tesla Stock A Buy?\n\nTesla stock has retreated more than 25% in 2024. TSLA shares have tumbled below the 50-day and 200-day lines after booking six weekly declines between late December and early February. Shares rose 2.5% to 187.91 last week, snapping its string of consecutive weekly losses.\n\nOn Feb. 5, Tesla stock sank 3.7% to 181.02, hitting a fresh eight-month low of 175.01 intraday. It's the S&P 500's worst performer so far in 2024. Tesla has a forward price-to-earnings ratio at a lofty 58.\n\nThe relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, is at a lowly 20, according to MarketSmith.\n\nIn 2023 Tesla doubled, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500 index. Tesla stock ranks ninth in the 35 member IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group. The stock has a 42 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Tesla stock also has a 21 Relative Strength Rating and a 69 EPS Rating.\n\nAlmost single-handedly, Elon Musk has turned the auto industry on its head. He has essentially forced it to get aboard the electric-vehicle train. It's a reason why Tesla has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially during its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021.\n\nTesla stock has had mammoth runs and could again.

From December 27 through the first week of February, shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker lost about 29% of their value.\n\nTheStreet\n\nBelow are some of the factors contributing to this downturn in the stock.\n\nLatest Earnings Results: For the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2023, Tesla reported net income that was 46% lower than what the company reported for Q4 2022. This highlighted Tesla's challenge of needing to increase spending while facing lower average sales prices and rising operating expenses. However, Q4 was an improvement compared to Q3, when operating income fell by more than 50% annually.\n\nRevenue and EPS Revisions: Over the last three months, there have been two upward EPS (earnings per share) revisions and 31 downward revisions on Wall Street regarding Tesla. A total of 36 revenue revisions have been consistently downward. The consensus has forecast an EPS of $3.20 for 2024, representing modest growth of less than 2.5% for the company.\n\nStretched Valuation Multiples: Tesla's stock experienced a 25% decline in the first few weeks of 2024, leading to a decrease in its forward multiple from 65 in October to 58 currently. Despite the decline, Tesla's stretched multiples still point to the stock being overvalued.\n\nPEG Ratio: A key metric for evaluating the fairness of valuation for growth stocks such as Tesla is the price to earnings/growth (PEG) multiple. Tesla's current forward PEG of 6x, considering a growth rate of 9% per year, is more favorable compared to the 18x ratio from about a quarter ago.\n\nOversold Condition: From a technical analysis perspective, Tesla's Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 29.5, significantly lower than the early January level of 46. Despite reaching as low as 17 at the end of January, the recent RSI climb to levels close to 30 may indicate a short-term reversal in bearish momentum, particularly following the strong selling pressure observed during Tesla's earnings week.\n\nTradingView\n\nPalantir Stock's Latest Developments\n\nPalantir's (PLTR) stock has been enjoying a prolonged period of significant optimism in the markets. Propelled largely by the buzz over artificial intelligence (AI), PLTR has surged by roughly 162% over the last 12 months.\n\nTheStreet\n\nBelow are some of the primary factors that have pushed Palantir shares upward.\n\nLatest Earnings Results: Palantir's Q4 earnings were better than expected, triggering a 30% surge in its share price as the market absorbed the results. The company reported EPS of 8 cents, in line with estimates, and revenues of $608.35 million, surpassing market estimates by $5.55 million.\n\nHowever, the highlight of the earnings report was the company's optimistic guidance for 2024. Palantir is now projecting revenue of between $2.652 billion and $2.668 billion, U.S. commercial revenue exceeding $640 million — representing a growth rate of at least 40% — and adjusted income from operations of $834 million to $850 million.\n\nAn Emergence From a Challenging Macro Environment: Palantir's net income surged from a loss of $124 million in Q3 2022 to a gain of $93.4 million in the most recent quarter. Additionally, Palantir's impressive gains occurred in a sluggish economic climate, compounded by challenges posed by high interest rates.\n\nThis advancement can be attributed to a combination of factors, including stronger-than-anticipated demand for AI-related products and services, minimal competition, and a share price that — despite a 162% increase in the last 12 months — remains 37% below its historical high in January 2021.\n\nRevenue and EPS Revisions: In the last three months, 15 analysts revised their EPS projections for Palantir upward, with no downward revisions. Meanwhile, 12 analysts revised their revenue projections upward. Three revised revenue projections downward. Consequently, the consensus for 2024 points to an EPS of 32 cents, indicating annual growth of nearly 30%.\n\nValuation and PEG Ratio: Despite trading at a forward P/E multiple of 67x, which is 170% above the industry average, Palantir's forward PEG ratio of 1.43 is particularly compelling, being below the industry average of 2.05x.\n\nOverbought Condition: With an RSI of 74.5 following the strong post-earnings rally, Palantir is currently overbought. While this suggests bullish momentum, it also presents potential for profit-taking. Overbought conditions typically signal caution for investors, indicating it may be prudent to wait for a price correction before buying shares. Investors may also consider hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of a potential price reversal.\n\nTradingView\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nTesla and Palantir are two tech stocks with substantial long-term growth potential. However, they are both currently at opposite ends of the spectrum.\n\nTesla and Palantir are both excellent buy-and-hold picks. But current momentum trends indicate that it might be prudent to consider buying Tesla while taking a more cautious approach to Palantir.\n\n(Disclaimers: this is not investment advice.

It delivered 1.8 million cars in 2023, including 1.2 million of its Model Y which became the best-selling vehicle of any kind, globally.\n\nTesla made headlines throughout the year for slashing prices to spur demand, because consumers were suffering under the pressures of high inflation and rising interest rates. The company reduced the sticker price of its electric vehicles by an average of 25.1% between December 2022 and December 2023.\n\nThat significantly impacted the company's bottom line. So, just how much of Tesla's $78.5 billion in car sales during 2023 was profit?\n\nTesla's earnings fell for the first time since 2017\n\nIn 2023, it cost Tesla $65.1 billion to manufacture and sell $78.5 billion worth of electric vehicles, which left the company with $13.4 billion in gross profit.\n\nDATA PROVIDED BY S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE, CHART BY THE MOTLEY FOOL.\n\nBy comparison, in 2022, it cost Tesla $49.6 billion to manufacture and sell $67.2 billion worth of electric vehicles, leaving a gross profit of $17.6 billion. That represented a gross profit margin of 26.2%, which declined to 17.1% in 2023, highlighting the effects of Tesla's price cuts.\n\nAt the bottom line, Tesla's companywide earnings per share -- which includes the financial results of its solar, storage, and services businesses -- came in at $3.12. It marked a 23% decline compared to its 2022 result, and it was the first time the company's annual earnings slipped since 2017.\n\nTesla's price cuts have continued in the early stages of 2024, so Wall Street analysts are betting its earnings could fall again this year. Tesla stock has plunged 54% from its all-time high because falling earnings have forced investors to reconsider the company's valuation, and it might struggle to recover in the short term.\n\nBut here's something interesting to consider. According to Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management, the majority of Tesla's profit might not come from selling cars in the long term. It might come from the company's autonomous self-driving software instead.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The EV stock has tumbled nearly 25% in five weeks. Its latest earnings report missed expectations and included a warning of stagnant vehicle volume growth . In reaction, several analysts slashed their investment ratings and lowered their price targets on the stock. Wood has been a longtime Tesla bull as the Elon Musk company is her flagship Innovation fund (ARKK )’s second biggest holding. Her conviction is centered around an accelerated shift to EVs as well as Tesla’s artificial intelligence capabilities. “We have been buying Tesla. There is so much negative psychology in the stock right now,” Wood said. “We think electric vehicles are going to continue to gain share and really take over the market in the next five years. And beyond that, robotaxis are going to change the landscape entirely.” TSLA 6M mountain Tesla shares over the past six months. The popular investor said she’s sticking with her call that her EV darling could hit $2,000 in five years, and she added that she is going to update the target. That valuation would translate into a more than $5 trillion market cap for Tesla. Wood is also confident that her other big holdings have more room to go. Some of her biggest holdings, including Coinbase , Roku, UiPath and Block , rallied significantly last year. “Our own stocks, which mostly are not the Magnificent 6 ... they have corrected tremendously. They’re now starting to show earnings momentum and surprises on the upside, not just revenue, but also earnings,” Wood said. “We think they have a long way to catch up.”"}

The electric vehicle (EV) giant reported record deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023. Production ramp-up at Gigafactory 4 and 5 and the introduction of new models, including Semi and Cybertruck, are set to support long-term delivery growth.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Tesla’s energy generation and storage revenue outlook is promising. Robust liquidity and the solid potential of its charging business are other positives. While shrinking margins remain a near-term concern, the Zacks analyst expects Tesla to deliver outsized returns in the long run on the back of output ramp-up and the introduction of new models.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Tesla here >>>)\n\n\n\nBroadcom’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry over the past year (+107.9% vs. +83.2%). The company is benefiting from the strong deployment of generative AI which it expects to contribute more than 25% of semiconductor revenues in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nVMware is expected to contribute $12 billion to revenues. Infrastructure software revenues are expected to be $20 billion while semiconductor solutions revenues are expected to increase in the mid to high-single-digit percentage range on a year-over-year basis in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\nBroadcom expects networking revenues to grow nearly 30% year over year in fiscal 2024 driven by accelerating deployment of networking connectivity and expansion of AI accelerators in hyperscalers. Wireless revenues are expected to remain stable on a year-over-year basis. However, server storage, broadband, and industrial revenues are expected to decline in fiscal 2024.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on Broadcom here >>>)\n\n\n\nShares of McDonald's have outperformed the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry over the past year (+10.7% vs. +5.6%). The company is benefiting from robust comparable restaurant sales growth, menu price increase and positive guest counts. Also, its emphasis on digital initiatives, marketing efforts, campaigns and loyalty programs bodes well.\n\n\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, digital sales (from the top six markets) came in at $9 billion, contributing 40% to the company’s system-wide sales. Given the rise in digital adoption, the company remains optimistic and anticipates the initiatives to drive sales and average checks in the upcoming periods.\n\n\n\nEarnings estimates for 2024 have increased in the past 30 days, depicting analysts’ optimism about the stock’s growth potential. However, inflationary pressures and stiff competition are primary headwinds.\n\n\n\n(You can read the full research report on McDonald’s here >>>)\n\n\n\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

The Elon Musk-run company continues to whipsaw, and has offered something for both the bulls and bears to work with over the last couple of years.\n\nThe shares lost two-thirds of their value in 2022, which brought a windfall for those who were short on the electric vehicle (EV) giant. However, as has been the case over the longer term, the more persistent short sellers eventually burned their fingers – and a lot of money – as Tesla stock more than doubled in 2023.\n\nThe stock has had a terrible start to 2024, and bears seem to sense an opportunity yet again in what they see as an “overvalued automaker.”\n\nWhy Is Tesla Stock Falling in 2024?\n\nNot much has gone right for Tesla in 2024, ranging from the macro level to the company-specific level, and more importantly, from a leadership level. At the beginning of the year, Tesla reignited the EV price war – this time, through price cuts in China. The price cuts only exacerbated the selling in Chinese EV names like NIO (NIO), Xpeng Motors (XPEV), and Li Auto (LI).\n\nTesla’s Q4 earnings were also poorly received. While investors might have overlooked the slight miss on the bottom line, management's commentary on 2024 deliveries - which it said “may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023” - spooked investors.\n\nI believe a part of Tesla’s rally was driven by the long-term delivery CAGR of 50% that Musk famously touted in early 2021. Now, 2024 could mark the third consecutive year when the company’s deliveries will arrive below - or rather, much below - that level.\n\nWith the Cybertruck still a long way from mass production, and the new low-cost model yet to be announced, Tesla lacks any real short-term growth drivers. The macro environment hasn't been favorable either, with the slowdown in China – Tesla’s biggest overseas market – seeming to worsen by the day. The sentiment toward EV stocks is already quite tepid, as the demand growth is not as strong as most believed it would be.\n\nElon Musk’s Controversies Take a Toll on TSLA Stock\n\nControversies over Musk haven’t helped matters, as the billionaire has threatened to build artificial intelligence (AI) products elsewhere, unless he has more control over Tesla. That goal faces a new roadblock after a Delaware court voided his gigantic $56 billion compensation plan.\n\nWhile reports of Musk using drugs are not new, a Wall Street Journal report says that some Tesla board members also felt pressured to take drugs with Musk, fearing that not doing so would upset the mercurial CEO.\n\nTesla has never been a shining example of corporate governance, which was well exemplified when Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick voided Musk’s compensation package, questioning the board’s independence as well as whether it even negotiated the fat pay package before its approval.\n\nIt isn’t the first time Tesla stock has fallen because of Musk’s actions, as a large part of the stock’s 2022 sell-off could be attributed to his antics surrounding his Twitter (now X) acquisition.\n\nTesla Stock Forecast: Analysts Get Apprehensive\n\nA section of the market, which includes long-standing bulls like Cathie Wood, continues to be bullish on Tesla, and her ARK Invest believes that Tesla’s target market will rise multi-fold with the launch of the low-cost model. Then we have the bearish camp, which continues to dislike Tesla, even irrespective of any positive developments.\n\nHowever, the recent events have made even some former bulls apprehensive about Tesla. Daiwa downgraded the shares from “outperform” to “neutral,” citing the lax corporate governance among other factors. Ross Gerber, a key Tesla shareholder, also believes that Musk's behavior is taking a toll on the stock.\n\nPiper Sandler, which continues to be “overweight” on Tesla, lowered its target price by $70 to $225. Even Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster, who is far from being a Tesla bear, also sounded cautious after the company’s disappointing 2024 outlook.\n\nTesla now has a consensus rating of “Hold” from analysts, which is a markdown from the average “Moderate Buy” rating a month back. The stock’s mean target price of $221.31 is almost 20% higher than yesterday’s close.\n\nCan TSLA Stock Recover in 2024?\n\nTesla shares have gone through even worse turmoil previously, but have eventually recovered. That said, the company faces several uncertainties and unknowns in the near term, which makes the short-term outlook quite hazy.\n\nThat said, for those who believe in Musk and the Tesla story, the dip could be an opportunity to double down on those bets, as it still remains one of the most consequential companies of our times, with a presence in multiple exciting industries like electric cars, renewable energy, autonomous driving, robotics, and supercomputers.\n\nFor bears, perhaps no price would be a bargain for buying Tesla shares, as it has and might continue to trade at premium valuations when benchmarked against legacy automakers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: NIO , XPEV , LI .

As CEO Elon Musk put it during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, as long as interest rates remain elevated, profit margins \"won't be that good\" for the upcoming year.\n\nSo after years of monumental growth, Tesla finds itself in unfavorable territory. With management forecasting that growth will slow in 2024, the stock shed more than 10% in the wake of the earnings report, and remains nearly 50% below its all-time high. Is it time to finally sell the electric vehicle (EV) champion?\n\nBreaking down 2023: A mixed bag\n\nAlthough 2024 isn't shaping up to be stellar, 2023 had some bright spots. Most notably, Tesla made remarkable progress in vehicle production and deliveries. Total production increased by 35% to more than 1.85 million vehicles. Similarly, deliveries surged by 38% to 1.81 million. As a result, Tesla's revenue reached $96.7 billion, a new record for the company, helping its stock price more than double in 2023 after a massive decline in 2022.\n\nThough it was a record year in some ways for Tesla, 2023 is expected to be remembered as the year when its profits started declining. While the company's revenue was at an all-time high, Tesla's decision to slash prices across its most popular models led to a drop in profit margins. In Q1 2022, Tesla enjoyed gross profit margins of almost 30% and operating margins of 19%. Since then, they have decreased by nearly half to 17% and 8%, respectively.\n\nMotley Fool Returns Market-beating stocks from our flagship service.

Volatility profiles based on trailing-three-year calculations of the standard deviation of service investment returns.\n\nWith interest rates likely to remain elevated compared to where they've been for most of the past decade, the prospects of Tesla having a bounce-back year seem slim. While price cuts were helpful to a certain degree, there are few other remaining options to maintain volume growth. As Musk said on the latest earnings call, as long as interest rates stay higher, keeping monthly payments on auto loans higher, the company's sales and profits will take a hit: \"There are no tricks to get around this,\" he said.\n\nBuilding for the future\n\nTesla management was extremely transparent about 2024's projected lack of growth in the earnings call. However, there was a silver lining.\n\nAs they described it, Tesla is currently \"between two major growth waves.\" The first one was primarily driven by the global expansion of its Model 3 and Model Y (the best-selling vehicle in the world last year). But now things are shifting.\n\nTesla plans on using this time to buckle down and prepare for a new period of growth that a handful of endeavors will drive. The most promising is autonomous driving. While its systems are yet to achieve the coveted autonomy levels of 4 or 5, at which point human drivers no longer need to be involved, Tesla made significant progress in 2023 and expects that progress to continue in 2024.\n\nAnother hoped-for driver of future growth is what management has dubbed the \"next-gen\" vehicle. In recognition that its vehicles are out of reach for most buyers, Tesla is in the beginning stages of designing and producing a vehicle that Musk hopes will cost only around $25,000. Admitting that his timelines are, at times, overly optimistic, Musk thinks the car could go on sale by late 2025.\n\nThe third component of Tesla's future growth is its humanoid robot, Optimus. The company aims for Optimus to be capable of replacing humans in dangerous or repetitive tasks, and it holds the potential to disrupt labor markets across several industries. Musk believes it will be a \"revolutionary product\" with the potential to exceed the value of all other ventures at Tesla. Management says shipments of the robot are expected to begin sometime in 2025.\n\nArrows-Out Expand NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Today's Change (-2.64%) -$5.11 Current Price $188.46 Arrow-Thin-Down YTD 1w 1m 3m 6m 1y -0.55% 5y Price VS S&P TSLA Key Data Points Market Cap $616B Day's Range $187.28 - $194.73 52wk Range $152.37 - $299.29 Volume 85,488,620 Avg Vol 115,784,129 Gross Margin 18.25% Dividend Yield N/A\n\nA much-needed grain of salt\n\nDue to Tesla's popularity and its position in the spotlight, any negative news about it is often exaggerated. The growth it experienced over the past few years is going to slow down. But are things spiraling out of control as they often are portrayed to be? Probably not.\n\nTesla is entering a new chapter, but not an unfamiliar one. Years ago, Tesla was refining and developing the foundations that later helped it catapult to the top of the EV industry. Now, a similar situation is unfolding. The only difference is that this time around, this phase will see it investing in technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\nAt worst, Tesla belongs in \"hold\" territory as we wait and see how development progresses. But for those with some time on their side and a conviction that Musk will fulfill his goal of making Tesla the most valuable company in the world, the recent share price dip looks all the more enticing."}

After trending lower, shares tumbled further in response to the company’s quarterly results. Even as it may appear the dust has settled, one can make a convincing argument on either side about where TSLA is headed from here.\n\nOn one hand, plenty of strong long-term catalysts remain in motion. In time, they could help assuage key concerns at present. On the other hand, momentum could stay on the side of the skeptics. Sentiment about Tesla, and the EV sector overall, remains downbeat. So, is it time to buy, sell, or hold? Let’s find out.\n\nTSLA Stock Could Keep Hibernating During ‘EV Winter’\n\nSince the start of the year, shares in electric vehicle manufacturers have been in some market commentators have coined “EV winter.”\n\nInvestors continue to bail on EV stocks, from established names like Tesla, to the myriad of U.S., Chinese, and European early-stage “EV contenders.”\n\nWhile shares in smaller peers are getting hammered by underwhelming delivery numbers and continued high cash burn, it’s a set of different issues placing pressure on TSLA stock.\n\nThe market is bidding down shares, for two reasons: the prospect of Tesla experiencing slower sales growth this year and the prospect of margins/profitability staying under pressure.\n\nThat said, with shares down by over 40% from their 52-week high, some bullish investors may believe these headwinds are already baked into TSLA’s valuation. In their eyes, long-term growth catalysts (more below) could eventually drive a rebound.\n\nHowever, while TSLA may be “cheap” relative to its 52-week high, shares remain pricey in terms of traditional financial metrics.\n\nAs the company contends with its growth and margin issues, investors could continue to be hesitant to pay top dollar for shares. This could keep shares in hibernation. Or worse, result in a further de-rating.\n\nMajor Catalysts May Not Immediately Save the Day\n\nPreviously, I have talked about how hitting two milestones could kick off the next boom for TSLA stock. I’m talking about both Tesla successfully bringing fully autonomous driving technology and a low-priced vehicle model to market.\n\nThese breakthroughs, coupled with other catalysts (improving macro conditions in the U.S. and China, decreased competition from smaller competitors folding) could result in a return to high sales growth, and a rebound in margins.\n\nUnfortunately, while these major catalysts are identifiable, it may take years before they all play out. While interest rates are still likely to come down this year, China’s current economic challenges could continue to affect demand growth in what is the world’s largest EV market.\n\nThere’s high uncertainty about whether Tesla will successfully bring bona fide “full self-driving” technology to market. Tesla CEO Elon Musk himself has stated that a lower-priced EV model isn’t set to debut until the second half of 2025.\n\nDelays could always push this date back to 2026 (or later). In the meantime, between now and when the first EV sector green shoots emerge, TSLA could stay on a downward trajectory.\n\nBottom Line: Sell/Avoid, Until Tesla Reaches This Price\n\nThe possibility of further high growth has yet to disappear with Tesla. Even if “EV winter” persists through the spring, summer, and fall, don’t expect shares to fall down to single-digit/low-teens forward multiple. That’s the valuation that incumbent automotive stocks are currently trading at.\n\nInstead, TSLA could bottom out at a valuation on par with other “Magnificent Seven” stocks (30-40 times forward earnings). Based on current earnings forecasts, for Tesla stock that would be between around $100 to $125 per share.\n\nWhile it may seem far-fetched that another more-than-40% drop is possible, don’t forget what happened the last time sentiment for this stock bottomed-out. Before bouncing back in early 2023, shares fell to a valuation as low as 34 times earnings.\n\nWith this, here’s the bottom line. Sell/avoid TSLA stock for now, but keep it on your watchlist, as shares could once again become a growth stock bargain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

A recent warning of slower deliveries. Now some on Wall Street believe Tesla no longer deserves to be among the coveted ” Magnificent Seven ,” and are suggesting alternatives that could replace Elon Musk ‘s company. “The Magnificent Seven now looks more like the Magnificent Six as Tesla falls from the crowd,” billionaire investor Leon Cooperman , CEO of the Omega Family Office, said Tuesday on CNBC’s ” Squawk Box .” Tesla has certainly had a tough start in 2024. The electric vehicle stock has tumbled 26% in five weeks. Its latest earnings report missed expectations and included a warning of stagnant vehicle volume growth . In reaction, several analysts slashed their investment ratings and lowered their price targets on the stock. Tesla’s sharp decline also significantly lowered its weighting in the S & P 500, falling to the No. 10 spot. (The equity benchmark is ranked by market capitalization.) Meanwhile, there are now 29 companies that contributed more to S & P 500 earnings than Tesla, according to Strategas Securities. The research firm identified three companies with both market cap weighting and earnings contributions (for the next 12 months) larger than Tesla — Berkshire Hathaway , Broadcom and Eli Lilly . “Berkshire spent last year fliting with the top seven, but Broadcom and Lilly have steadily gained share,” Strategas said in a note. “The net income contribution for [Broadcom] is just a 0.1% difference from its market cap weight which may mean there could be greater multiple expansion.” Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire has historically outperformed the broader market when volatility is high. The conglomerate’s Class B shares have gained more than 10% year to date. Eli Lilly’s quarterly results blew past expectations on Tuesday, benefiting from the strong launch of its new weight loss drug, Zepbound, and higher prices for its blockbuster diabetes treatment, Mounjaro. The stock has soared nearly 20% this year. Broadcom shares doubled last year, helped by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. JPMorgan on Tuesday resumed coverage with an overweight rating, calling Broadcom “a technology infrastructure powerhouse with semiconductor leadership positions in AI.” The Wall Street firm noted that Broadcom is the No. 2 global AI semiconductor supplier with more than $8 billion in estimated revenue for 2024. The stock has gained nearly 10% this year. — CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed reporting."}

The company's ongoing challenges were laid bare in its fourth-quarter earnings call, where management outlined a bleak outlook for growth and margins amid rising competition from low-cost Chinese rivals like BYD.\n\nBut while Tesla's near-term prospects are grim, what does the future hold? Let's discuss some trends that could evolve over the next decade and possibly make or break the company.\n\nArrows-Out Expand NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Today's Change (-2.64%) -$5.10 Current Price $188.47 Arrow-Thin-Down YTD -22.08% 1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y Price VS S&P TSLA S&P Key Data Points Market Cap $616B Day's Range $187.28 - $194.73 52wk Range $152.37 - $299.29 Volume 85,831,196 Avg Vol 115,784,129 Gross Margin 18.25% Dividend Yield N/A\n\nCan Tesla's automotive business be saved?\n\nOver the next ten years, Tesla's success will depend on protecting its market share from a growing list of Chinese rivals. BYD is likely the biggest threat because of its high level of vertical integration. The Chinese rival not only manufactures its batteries, but also owns stakes in lithium mines to ensure a steady supply of low-cost raw materials.\n\nAccording to Reuters, a battery accounts for around 40% of a new electric vehicle's (EV) price. And over the coming years, Tesla will need to pay serious attention to this side of the industry if it wants to stay competitive.\n\nIn May, the company broke ground on its first in-house lithium refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The over $1 billion project could help expand the company's access to battery-grade lithium.\n\nMotley Fool Returns Market-beating stocks from our flagship service.

And he expects the new facility to produce enough battery-grade lithium for 1 million EVs by 2025. For context, Tesla produced 1.85 million cars in 2023, so this project could bring substantial virtual integration to the company.\n\nConsider the other growth drivers\n\nWhile investors must wait for Tesla's automotive business to possibly regain its mojo, the company has several other growth drivers that could rise in importance over the next decade. These include self-driving cars, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that experts at Boston Consulting believe could become widespread by 2035.\n\nTesla is investing in this opportunity through a new supercomputer called Dojo, which will analyze the data generated from thousands of Tesla vehicles on the road with its self-driving software installed.\n\nOver time, these \"full-self-driving\" (FSD) installations (which cost $12,000 plus a $99 monthly subscription) could become a major source of revenue for Tesla, and possibly be licensed to other automakers. Expanding into AI software could also help create an economic moat around Tesla's business and prevent it from getting trapped in a race to the bottom with BYD and other low-cost Chinese automakers.\n\nInvestors should remember, however, that the AI thesis could take over a decade to play out. And Tesla isn't the only company working on self-driving and other autonomous mobility solutions.\n\nTesla stock is a hold\n\nWhile Tesla is a resilient company with a track record of overcoming challenges, it is unclear if its vertical integration efforts and other growth drivers will be enough to maintain the explosive stock price growth investors have become used to. And with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 57, shares are quite expensive considering the challenges ahead. Tesla stock looks like a hold until more information becomes available."}

They are down more than 25% now, and some analysts getting a bit nervous. The latest, the team at Daiwa Capital Markets downgrading Tesla to neutral with issues surrounding CEO Elon Musk piling up. Our next guest says he's lightened his Tesla position substantially over the last six months. Joining us now is Ross Gerber, Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management CEO.\n\nRoss, it is always good to see you. So maybe I'll start there, Ross. The team at Daiwa, as we mentioned, they downgraded Tesla to neutral, Ross, and they're telling their clients corporate governance concerns aggravating already tough financial conditions in 2024. So they're going a bit cautious. What do you think of that take, Ross? Do you agree with it?\n\nROSS GERBER : Yeah. I mean, there's just a list of concerns that that's just one of them and probably one of the least important of the concerns considering the rapidly declining earning estimates and the lack of any transparency of what Tesla sales will be this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd so Tesla went from a very fast-growing company with lots of potential to now basically sort of almost like stalling and really stuck almost desperately trying to sell their vehicles now. And, you know, it's really problematic because I think it's all self-inflicted. You know, Tesla is a great company with a CEO who is severely conflicted is the nicest way to put it.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So Ross, you guys have lightened your load in terms of how many shares you own, but you still own a lot of shares.\n\nROSS GERBER : Yeah.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So I'm just-- you know, what keeps you-- what keeps the faith when you're looking at Tesla here? What keeps you in the stock? There's a big universe of stocks out there, so what keeps you in this one?\n\nROSS GERBER : Well, you have to look at our situation. We bought Tesla at $3 a share, so for us, it's all profit. So every time I sell Tesla for many of my clients, there's a tax consequence of up to 30% of that profit. So that's something we have to really consider when we're selling the stock. Now, many of our clients do have it in retirement accounts like IRA accounts, which gives us a lot more flexibility.\n\nBut it's really about what allocation is right for our clients, and Tesla was our largest holding for a very long time. But when-- you know, it really started with the anti-Semitic comments, and we had clients calling to sell their Tesla stock who are now very happy because they sold more like a $250 a share.\n\nAnd, you know, we continue to believe that Elon is eroding the value of the brand, and so we continued to sell the stock where appropriate to get it down to an allocation where we're at now, which is around 3% in our ETF GK and for our clients around 3% to 4% depending on their situation.\n\nNow, we do have some Tesla-fanatic clients that don't want to give up their stock, but it's hurting. It's hurting people a lot this year. And finally, the cost of Elon's behavior is really hurting shareholders. And it's really unfortunate because the reason we're holding the stock is the long-term potential of Tesla is immense. So it's this catch-22.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And Ross, when you say that Elon Musk is eroding the brand, I'm just interested because a lot of people, Ross, when they think of Tesla, they think Musk. And when they think Musk, they think Tesla. I mean, they think of him as just foundational. Are you suggesting you'd like him to sort of exit stage right here?\n\nROSS GERBER : No, I mean, really it's just to shut up. I mean, you know, he spends his weekend just railing on immigrants and the immigration issue, and he himself being an immigrant. And the perception of somebody who's intelligent who can get an H-1B visa saying that people who don't have educations don't deserve to be in this country is really not a way to sell cars, especially in a state like California, its biggest market, where Tesla sales are down year-over-year, one must finally accept the reality that Elon's white supremacist motivations is absolutely damaging the brand because he is equated to Tesla. But to pretend that he's not damaging the brand at this point is simply ignorant.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So Ross, how do you fix it? Because there have been suggestions. I know you yourself had sort of a short-lived run for the board at Tesla. There have been suggestions that the board is too close for him, that they're not keeping him in check. But is there any realistic expectation that there could actually be independent or more independent board members added at Tesla?\n\nROSS GERBER : Well, I think this is the pickle. And one of the reasons we've sold a big chunk of stock was because I don't see how this works. Because when I ran for the board, I realized very quickly that there was actually no desire for independence or any retail investment representation on the board at all.\n\nI was like this is definitely not a welcome wagon, you know. And so, you know, I got out of it, and now I've decided to sell some of my stock because I think that's what investors have to do when the company and the board isn't going to behave in the best interests of its shareholders, which it's really behaving in the best interests of one of its shareholders and not the other 87%.\n\nSo I think this is a real problem for Tesla. I don't see how the board can move forward in its current makeup because anything they do will be sued because essentially, Delaware has ruled that it's not an independent board. And it's a requirement, you know, that it is an independent board. So if they get new board members that are truly independent of Elon, this isn't going to work very well for Elon. And I'm sure he doesn't want that.\n\nAnd, you know, I want to make it very clear, it's not my goal to be on the board of Tesla. I'm done with that. I have no desire at all. And nor is it my goal to see Elon leave Tesla. My goal is for Elon to leave Twitter and to go back to Tesla. He needs to get off Twitter and stop making his outrageous opinions known to the public on a daily basis and go back to his job as CEO of Tesla. And that's really what needs to happen.\n\nAnd so if that doesn't happen, I think Tesla is drifting in a place where I don't know where it goes until there's somebody or somebody on the board that actually wants to confront Elon and expects Tesla to get better results.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: But Ross, you know, you kind of know, though, when you invest with Elon Musk, he is a different kind of CEO, right? I mean, you know that when you commit capital to his companies, Elon isn't Jamie Dimon, right? He's a different kind of guy. He's going to make his opinions known. I mean, you have to know that as an investor before you move in, right?\n\nROSS GERBER : Well, I've been doing this for 10 years with Elon and Tesla. And, you know, it's interesting when he needed money and Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy, he was very nice to me and everybody else who was giving him money that supported Tesla. Everybody thinks it's only Elon, and Elon, obviously, is the innovator of our time. But there were many investors like myself and my firm and several other firms that stepped up when nobody else would. And Elon was a different guy back then.\n\nSo now that he's successful and he's the richest man in the world, he decides to use his capital to buy a social media app so that he can express outrageous opinions on a daily basis. You know, this is just not a good development for the company.\n\nYou know, it's just like Napoleon. Napoleon started off really well as well and had a pretty good run until he got involved with Russia. So Twitter is like Elon's Russia, and he's going to end up on Elba if he keeps this up. So I just I love somebody to try to talk some sense into this guy. He's certainly not listening to me.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Ross Gerber, maybe he'll watch this interview. We'll see. And he'll listen.\n\nROSS GERBER : He probably will. I'm sure.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Ross, thanks a lot. Good to see you. Appreciate your perspective."}

That’s worse than Boeing, where the “Max” in its 737 Max plane series seems to indicate the number of things that can go wrong, and Etsy, one among the many tech companies laying off staff like mad because business is bad (and not just because they want to keep all their profits to themselves).\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe technoking’s new clothes\n\nIn Tesla’s annual report, the company explicitly lays out that it is “highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer.” That’s a plus when “he really has made a lot of shareholders a lot of money, and they really would be happy to give him the gold statue and whatever other dumb things he might want in exchange for even a fraction of his entrepreneurial attention,” as Bloomberg’s Matt Levine put it. But it’s a negative when his antics have helped erase more than $200 billion of shareholder value."}

The strategy has been driven by a series of price cuts across key markets in the U.S., Europe and China.\n\nThe Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol MAGS, has risen nearly 12% so far this year, while Tesla shares are down nearly 25%. Meta Platforms (META) , whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg was challenged to a cage match last year by Tesla's Elon Musk, is up nearly 40%.\n\nTesla's profit margins, probably the most closely tracked metric by analysts on Wall Street, narrowed to 17.6% over the three months ended in December. That's as a result of the price cuts and, alongside a weaker-than-expected bottom line of 71 cents a share, added more fuel to those betting against the world's biggest EV maker.\n\nPiper Sandler: 'aging product lineup' at Tesla\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter, meanwhile, sees more price cuts ahead thanks to what he calls an \"aging product lineup.\" He also trimmed his 2024 delivery estimate by around 11.5%, to 1.93 million units, following the group's disappointing fourth- quarter earnings, reported last month.\n\nTesla's net income doubled from fourth-quarter 2022 to $7.9 billion, but a good chunk of that was tied to a deferred tax gain of $5.9 billion. Costs linked to artificial-intelligence projects and the delayed Cybertruck pickup-truck launch ate deep into its bottom line.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nThe group also said that 2024 growth rates, in terms of vehicle deliveries, would be \"notably lower\" than 2023 levels. Wall Street forecasts indicate 2024 revenue growth would likely come in at 10%, indicating a full-year total of around $107 billion.\n\nPotter, meanwhile, lowered his price target on Tesla by $70, to $225 a share, while reiterating his overweight rating. The analyst cited the potential revenue generation from its growing energy business, which he sees contributing around 12% to top line growth in 2025, twice the 6% of last year.\n\nPotter values Tesla's automotive division, excluding its Full-Self-Driving driver-assistance system, at around $135 a share, with the rest of his $225 target tied to Tesla energy.\n\nTesla's energy division, which sells energy-storage and solar-energy systems, saw overall fourth-quarter revenue rise 10% from 2022 levels to around $1.31 billion. The full-year tally was just over $6 billion, a 54% gain from 2022 levels.\n\n\"Tesla is poised to capture 15% to 20% of global stationary battery deployments,\" Potter said.\n\nElon Musk: Tesla is 'between 2 growth waves'\n\nMusk himself told investors last month that Tesla is \"currently between two major growth waves,\" with \"Full-Self-Driving, next-gen vehicle and energy storage\" powering the group's next advance.\n\n\"Our energy-storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%,\" said Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's new chief financial officer, on last month's conference call.\n\n\"This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in 2024,\" he added. \"This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our Mega Factory in Lathrop.\"\n\nTesla shares were marked 4.9% lower in early Monday trading to change hands at $178.65 each, a move that would extend the stock's 2024 decline to around 28%."}

Piper Sandler lowering its price target on that stock. SAP, the German software firm, saying it is ditching all Tesla company cars. And the Wall Street Journal reporting that CEO Elon Musk has created a culture of drug-taking with certain members of the board. Pras Subramanian is here with the very latest. That's a lot of headlines, Pras.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, a lot to go through there. But a lot of people are talking about this journal story. A really well sourced article here alleging more drug use than we originally thought with the Elon Musk, a portfolio of different drugs that he's been taking, right? But the big-- the big story here is the board sort of knew about more of these things and didn't-- and didn't investigate these matters further. In fact, in some cases felt pressured to actually take drugs with Musk in order to carry a favor with them.\n\nSo I looked at the story. And I think of it as more of a board sort of not fully competent, not fully out for what shareholders their best interests-- and Josh I got to ask. You've been around the Valley. Like, have you ever heard anything like this before with tech companies?\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Well, I mean, a common-- a common criticism across all kinds of sectors and industries is that CEOs are often too close to the board. That's not, I mean, unusual. Well, you'll hear that about a lot of companies. And so I don't know if you would just ding them on that. I guess the question with this story in particular-- and to emphasize, these are allegations, right? That's all-- that's all what we have.\n\nI mean, certainly, we have seen Elon Musk smoke marijuana with Joe Rogan. He's talked about publicly as a prescription for ketamine. But yeah, to your point, I think the broader story prize is what it means for the board. And are-- they are they as responsible as they should be?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Right. I mean, when this comes on the heels of course, as well of a Delaware court slapping down his pay package and implying that the board was not doing its due diligence and its duty. And I think that drugs are salacious. The drug allegations are salacious and all that. But as we're talking about it, really, it comes to the core of is this a board that has enabled bad, erratic, whatever you want to call it, behavior on the part of Elon Musk? And is that indeed best for shareholders? And obviously, it's a lot easier to ask these questions, Pras, when the stock is down as much as it is down. What, it's down something like 40% from its highs last year. And I think it's down something like 27% thus far this year.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. I mean, a quarter of the value kind of gone in the last month. And the big thing you mentioned is that case, the Delaware case about how the judge there said that the-- the process to determine Musk's pay was, quote, \"deeply flawed.\" The judge said that Chair Robin Denholm was lackadaisical in her approach to oversight with Musk and everything sort of going on with that company. And I think that--\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Or is it also a true prize, just to be needed--\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: --that and correct me if I'm wrong. Tesla investors saw that plan and voted on it, right? And then Musk hit his targets. I mean, we should note that. It's not as though it was under the radar.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, the allegation is that they were not transparent enough when they set the targets and that they were sort of low-hanging fruit for him to hit. Isn't that the sort of what is an issue here?\n\nJOSH LIPTON: That's my point. I mean, I just want to make it clear to the audience. It's not as though this is just on the board. Tesla shareholders saw that plan, approved it, and he did hit his targets. Now, some may-- I know some of them apparently are arguing, well, I didn't have all the information I should have 10 years ago. I mean, a lot of people-- yeah, we can also skip ahead and say I didn't have the information I had 10 years from when I should have. I just want to make it clear to the audience. They did see the plan, correct?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It's interesting because these-- these-- these targets are really audacious, right? And somehow he hit them, and he made a lot of money.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: In 2018 people didn't even know if Tesla was going to be around.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right, right.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: I mean, right.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: But it makes you wonder, you know, sort of-- Musk has been sort of, I don't want to say, cagey with the truth but basically kind of audacious about what the goals can be for the company to hit. FSD is one big sort of a factor here. Did he sort of make some promises that weren't necessarily going to be true in order to hit these big, audacious goals? I'm not alleging-- I'm just alleging that, because he really hit some--\n\nIf you're a shareholder and you look at these goals, they're-- they're pretty very, very, very out there. You wouldn't necessarily think they would hit all of them, but they did from a stock price point of view. And then he got the big-- big awards. So what does that make you think about what he says about the company going forward? I'm not-- I'm not sure. But the board should be more on top of these things, I think. And I think you're right, Julie, about that. What are you disclosing about what this-- this package is exactly to the actual shareholders?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Right. And what are the relationships between the board members and Musk himself, you know? It seems like they-- some of them have relationships with his privately-held companies as well. Also as the journal points out, they are unusually well paid versus Board members across corporate America.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So that's part of it too.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Massive payments. There's one quick thing. I'm kind of curious about this. In the Valley at least, right, you have a lot of people who are on boards, who are executives, who own bits and pieces of other companies, is it-- was it more so the case with Tesla than other tech companies, for instance, like the PayPal mafia and people like that? Like, is that sort of the norm out there in the Valley? I'm not sure.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Well, I'm sure any number of directors probably there is a sense of a kind of live and let live, right? Where you feel like, listen, this guy, when he goes to Burning Man, what he's doing on his own time, you know, as long as it's not affecting the business, maybe they kind of-- the feeling is I'm not going to step in at this point, right? Now this-- this-- this journal article raises a host of new questions. But I think you kind of nailed it. That's sort of what's really being debated here is that relationship.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, and then long term value for stockholders, right?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yes, most definitely.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: All right. Thanks, Pras. Appreciate it."}

[+] bonus package. NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nKey Facts\n\nTesla’s stock fell as much as 6% to $175 before recovering slightly by market close to a 3.7% loss, bringing the limping auto titan’s year-to-date loss to a whopping 27%. That makes Tesla the worst-performing stock listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index. Tesla’s 2024 decline began with a post-earnings plunge after the company missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and revenue, but the latest selloff coincides with increased controversy surrounding Musk, who has clamored for significantly higher power within Tesla and taken to his X social media platform to spew fringe-right claims. Heightened concerns about Tesla’s board’s ability to govern Musk peaked with a Saturday report in the Wall Street Journal alleging Musk and Tesla board members have taken illegal drugs together (Musk previously claimed his drug tests contained “not even trace quantities” of drugs or alcohol).\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser website GO TO PAGE PLAY Forbes Business\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nThe allegations outlined in the Journal pose the latest “black cloud” on Tesla, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Forbes, partially attributing Monday’s stock dip to the salacious report.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nShares of Tesla have fallen more this year than the likes of Boeing, whose shares are down 21% in 2024 amid controversy about the safety of its commercial airplanes, and agricultural giant Archers-Daniels-Midland, whose shares are down 21% as it grapples with a probe into alleged accounting fraud.\n\nKey Background\n\nFor better and worse, Tesla stock has long been subject to the whims of the mercurial Musk, perhaps most famously proven during Tesla’s 65% selloff in 2022 as Musk offloaded a massive chunk of his Tesla holdings to fund his purchase of the social media platform now known as X. Tesla’s fortunes in 2024 are far worse than those of the other members of the “magnificent seven” tech stocks whose valuations ballooned last year. Apple is the only other member of the group whose shares are down year-to-date, at a far milder 2%, and Apple and Tesla are the only ones of the group not to report double-digit sales growth last quarter. Tesla’s profits declined 23% from 2022 to 2023, and analysts project negative bottom line growth again this year, according to FactSet.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nMusk is the world’s second-richest person with a net worth of $195 billion, according to our real-time estimates. Musk is about $55 billion poorer than he was at the end of 2023 thanks to Tesla stock’s drop and a Delaware judge’s axing of a $51 billion Tesla stock-based compensation for Musk last week."}

(TSLA) fell Monday morning after The Wall Street Journal on Saturday outlined the blurry personal and professional boundaries between Chief Executive (CEO) Elon Musk and the directors responsible for overseeing his work.\n\n“Several current or former directors at Tesla and SpaceX attend parties with him, go on exotic vacations and hang out at Burning Man, the Nevada arts and music festival,” according to the Journal. They also have “amassed shares worth hundreds of millions of dollars from their seats over the years, significantly more than what board members at other companies make for their service.”\n\nThe report comes just days after a Delaware court struck down Musk’s 2018 compensation package, which was valued at up to $55.8 billion. “The process leading to the approval of Musk’s compensation plan was deeply flawed,” wrote Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who cited his professional and personal ties to the directors with whom he negotiated the pay package.\n\nIn response, Musk said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that Tesla would hold a shareholder vote on transferring its state of incorporation to Texas from Delaware. The company relocated its corporate headquarters to Austin, Texas, from Palo Alto, California, in 2021 after Musk criticized California’s tax and regulatory environment.\n\nAdding to the bad news for Tesla investors Monday, German software giant SAP SE (SAP) will stop purchasing Tesla vehicles for its corporate fleet due to unpredictable deliveries and price swings, according to German newspaper Handelsblatt.\n\nIt follows German rental company Sixt, which in December dropped Tesla from its fleet because the company’s price cuts on new vehicles were devaluing its used fleet.

Several other things have snowballed that have put Tesla's future prospects into question. Against a backdrop of multiple examples of extreme weather that have exacerbated consumers' concerns with owning an electric vehicle (EV), the company itself has been under fire.\n\nLast week a Delaware judge ruled against the company in a lawsuit that has now voided CEO Elon Musk's lucrative pay package that was approved in 2018. A shareholder sued the company contending that the nearly $56 billion pay package wasn't fairly presented to investors and that Tesla's board of directors didn't act independently as it should.\n\nBut the decline in the share price may be more from two major weather events that have brought news coverage that highlights some concerns with owning an EV. Many consumers have yet to experience driving one, or even knowing an owner. So when a deep freeze hit the Midwest last month and Chicago-area Tesla owners couldn't charge batteries in weather with temperatures well below zero, some sector watchers thought that might push back the pace of EV adoption. Now an ongoing major weather event in Southern California has caused power outages that will leave some EV owners without the ability to charge their vehicles.\n\nMotley Fool Returns Market-beating stocks from our flagship service.

But Musk's credibility has taken a hit with news that his board of directors is working at his beck and call. There will be more to come related to the lawsuit on Musk's pay package.

Its electric vehicles readily receive applause or disdain, and its mercurial chief executive, Elon Musk, has more than his fair share of fans and foes.\n\nThe hit-or-miss nature of Tesla stock reflects the tug-of-war, given its one of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500.\n\nFor instance, Tesla shares tumbled during the 2022 bear market. Then, they more than doubled from their lows to their 2023 highs. More recently, they've fallen out of favor again, dropping nearly 30% since mid-December.\n\nThe sell-off likely surprised many, given hopes for ever-growing electric vehicle sales, new factories, and the launch of the much-hyped Cybertruck.\n\nHowever, Real Money Pro analyst Bruce Kamich wasn't shocked. He correctly predicted in early January that Tesla stock would fall, writing that his analysis concluded that Tesla shares had \"more risk than upside opportunity.\"\n\nKamich recently updated his analysis, and given his track record, investors may want to pay attention.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has seen Tesla's shares trade incredibly volatilely over the past two years. Shutterstock\n\nTesla is the EV sales leader, but growth slowed in 2023\n\nTesla reimagined the electric vehicle market. Rather than designing vehicles for environmentalists, Elon Musk concentrated the car company's efforts on building high-performance luxury cars.\n\nThe strategy worked. Its Model S Plaid outperformed top brands like Porsche, making it a fan of enthusiasts. It has since launched the highly popular Model Y, a crossover SUV, and the Model 3, a lower-cost sedan with high-performance roots.\n\nThe Model Y and the Model 3 are both offered in configurations that deliver eye-popping speed, with each able to go from zero to sixty miles per hour in under four seconds.\n\nMusk's focus on performance rather than economy has upturned the auto industry, arguably single-handedly setting EVs on a course to win away a significant share of auto sales from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.\n\nTesla has clearly profited from this approach. Its fourth-quarter revenue was $25 billion, and Wall Street analysts expect it will deliver $3.12 profit per share in 2024.\n\nThat's impressive, but Tesla has recently become a victim of its success. The widespread interest in EVs has led major rivals, including Mercedes, Ford, and GM, to launch their own EV alternatives, and those vehicles are biting into Tesla's market share.\n\nAccording to Cox Automotive, total U.S. EV sales surged by 40% in Q4 to 317,168. Tesla accounted for half of all EVs sold in the quarter. However, that's down from 62% in Q1 2023.\n\nThe loss in market share has happened despite Elon Musk cutting prices to spark sales. The combination of lower market share and lower prices has taken a stiff toll on the company's financial performance, leading to anemic 3% year-over-year revenue growth and a 40% decline in profit during the fourth quarter.\n\nGiven that backdrop, it's unsurprising that Tesla's shares have taken a nosedive this year.\n\nTesla's price charts result in a new price target\n\nKamich has used price and volume charts to analyze stocks or markets professionally for over 50 years. His technical analysis accurately forecasted that Tesla stock would reach $300 before declining to $193. Then, after a rally, it allowed him to accurately warn of the risk of downside in January.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nKamich reconsidered Tesla's daily and weekly charts on Feb. 1 for insight into what could be next for Tesla's stock. He also used a daily point-and-figure chart to calculate a new price target. Unfortunately (if you're a Tesla fan), Kamich thinks Tesla shares could still fall further.\n\n\"I can see an evolving bearish picture. The shares have weakened so far in 2024. Prices gapped lower in the middle of January and have not shown us signs of a bottom reversal. The popular moving averages have weakened, and now we can see a bearish dead or death cross-sell signal, with the 50-day line falling below the slower-to-react 200-day line,\" writes Kamich. \"The trading volume has been neutral, and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is still pointed down. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bearish alignment below the zero line.\"\n\nOn-balance volume is essentially a running total of up minus down volume, while MACD measures momentum.\n\nSince up-day volume is poor relative to down-day volume and the MACD is negative, Kamich is cautious.\n\nIt doesn't help that Kamich's analysis of point-and-figure charts is also worrisome. Using a daily P&F chart, he calculates a Tesla stock price target of $150.\n\n\"Tesla is looking poised for further declines,\" concludes Kamich. \"Avoid the long side of [Tesla] TSLA.\""}

The judge found the share-based compensation was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to Musk, currently ranked by Forbes magazine as the world's richest person.\n\nTesla's 10-year pay agreement with Musk reached in 2018 would be worth around $51 billion at Tuesday's closing price for Tesla stock, accounting for the cost to Musk to exercise the options.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThat would be about a quarter of his $210.6 billion fortune, as calculated by Forbes magazine, which currently ranks about $2 billion ahead of LVMH (LVMH.PA) , opens new tab CEO Bernard Arnault of France and his family.\n\n\"Swept up by the rhetoric of 'all upside,' or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?\" wrote Kathaleen McCormick of Delaware's Court of Chancery.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nMcCormick directed the Tesla shareholder who challenged the pay plan to work with Musk's legal team on an order implementing the decision. It can be appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court once the parties agree on a final order and on fees for the shareholder's attorneys, which will be paid by Tesla.\n\nThe decision comes as Tesla warns of slowing growth and the electric vehicle industry is re-evaluating demand . Tesla has become the world's most valuable automaker under Musk, but much of that value is based on expectations of future breakthroughs, such as self-driving robotaxis.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\n\"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\" Musk said in a post on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022.\n\nMusk's lawyer did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.\n\n\"Good day for the good guys,\" said an email from Greg Varallo, an attorney for Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta, who brought the lawsuit in 2018.\n\nCEO COMPENSATION\n\n\"The incredible size of the biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum - seems to have been calibrated to help Musk achieve what he believed would make 'a good future for humanity',\" wrote McCormick in her 201-page opinion.\n\n[1/2] Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of SpaceX and Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de... Purchase Licensing Rights , opens new tab Read more\n\nThe ruling comes as Tesla is preparing another round of compensation negotiations with the CEO. Musk said in a post on X this month that he was uncomfortable leading Tesla unless he had 25% of the voting control. The billionaire owned around 13% of the company at the time and he said negotiations would not start until McCormick had ruled.\n\n\"Given the way she describes the board process - through the testimony of the directors - there is no way that his most recent demand for 25% can get approved,\" Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, said. \"It's dead on arrival.\"\n\nMcCormick wrote that many of the directors on Tesla's board, including current members Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother, and James Murdoch, son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, lacked independence because of their close personal ties with the CEO. Two of Tesla's other current directors, Robyn Denholm and Ira Ehrenpreis, showed a lack of independence in the pay decision, she said.\n\nThe board currently has eight members including its CEO.\n\nRoss Gerber, president and CEO at Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management and a Tesla investor, told Reuters the ruling showed the company needed to replace at least three directors with independent board members before it can negotiate a new pay package for Musk.\n\n\"Essentially, the entire corporate structure of Tesla has been deemed, like not appropriate for a public company,\" Gerber said.\n\nTesla directors argued during the trial that the company was paying to ensure one of the world's most dynamic entrepreneurs continued to dedicate his attention to the electric vehicle maker. Antonio Gracias, a Tesla director from 2007 to 2021, called the package \"a great deal for shareholders\".\n\nTornetta 's lawyers argued the Tesla board never told shareholders the goals were easier to achieve than the company was acknowledging and that internal projections showed Musk was quickly going to qualify for large portions of the pay package.\n\nThe plaintiff's legal team also argued the board had a duty to offer a smaller pay package or look for another CEO and that they should have required Musk to work full-time at Tesla instead of allowing him to focus on side projects, like SpaceX and X.\n\nKristin Hull, founder of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, described the board as beholden to Musk, a problem she said is common at other big technology companies. \"This is the bro-show,\" she said of the situation.\n\nThe pay package granted stock option awards for approximately 304 million shares that Musk can buy at about $23.33 each, well below $191.59 where it closed on Tuesday. Musk earned all 12 tranches of stock option awards as Tesla hit escalating financial and operational goals.\n\nMusk has not exercised any of the options and once he does he is required to hold the shares for five years before selling, according to McCormick.\n\nHe was not guaranteed any salary.\n\nTesla's value ballooned to briefly top $1 trillion in 2021 from $50 billion when the package was negotiated.\n\nAmit Batish at Equilar, an executive pay research firm, estimated in 2022 that Musk's package was around six times larger than the combined pay of the 200 highest-paid executives in 2021.\n\nReporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Noel Randwich and Hyun Joo Jin in San Francisco, Jody Godoy in New York and Kanishka Singh, Eric Beech and Dan Whitcomb in Washington; Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Anna Driver and Jamie Freed\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. , opens new tab"}

The shares of this electric vehicle (EV) giant have declined by over 23% year-to-date, pressured by concerns over signs of softer demand for EVs. Furthermore, heightened competition in the EV market has compelled the company to consistently lower its average selling prices, negatively affecting its profit margins and share price.\n\nAdding to the challenges, Tesla’s management has offered a cautious outlook for 2024. The company anticipates a significant decrease in volumes compared to 2023, falling well below its targeted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50%. Although this expected slowdown in volume growth is driven by a strategic shift towards developing new products, such as its next-generation low-cost EV, it is perceived as a negative development.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, let's analyze various factors to gain insights into what the future holds for Tesla stock in 2024.\n\nThe Bull Case for Tesla Stock\n\nTesla is the world’s leading manufacturer of fully electric vehicles. In addition, it provides solar energy generation solutions and energy storage devices. Tesla achieved a remarkable milestone by manufacturing 1,845,985 consumer vehicles and delivering 1,808,581 units in 2023. Notably, the Model Y emerged as its best-selling vehicle worldwide in 2023, with over 1.2 million units delivered. This stellar performance solidifies Tesla’s dominant position in the EV market, showcasing its resilience in the face of intensified competition.\n\nLooking ahead, Tesla’s strategic initiatives to expand its manufacturing capabilities, along with the introduction of new vehicle models and next-generation platforms, position it well for growth. Furthermore, the company’s commitment to cost reduction, including the ability to source and manufacture components locally, provide a strategic advantage. This enables Tesla to offer competitive pricing, plus maintain and grow its market share.\n\nIt is important to note that Tesla strategically utilizes its industry-leading profit margins to aggressively lower prices and boost sales volumes. This approach poses considerable challenges for competitors, as they are compelled to reduce prices, even if it impacts their profitability. Tesla has consistently reduced its cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, and in Q4 2023, its COGS per vehicle came in slightly above $36,000, compared to nearly $40,000 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nTesla remains committed to expanding its production and identifying additional cost efficiencies throughout 2024. By prioritizing the reduction of the COGS per vehicle, Tesla aims to fortify its profit margins, which will drive further volume growth in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIn addition to reducing the cost per vehicle, Tesla is enhancing the performance and functionality of its cars to bolster demand. This involves advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven products like Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Autopilot, along with various software features. These strategic initiatives position Tesla advantageously to maintain and protect its market share.\n\nBeyond EVs, Tesla experienced significant growth in its energy storage deployments, which reached 14.7 GWh in 2023 — more than double the previous year’s figures. Further, its Energy Generation and Storage division's profit nearly quadrupled in 2023. Finally, the Services & Other business swung from a loss of approximately $500 million in 2019 to a profit of about $500 million in 2023.\n\nTo sum it up, Tesla is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing shift towards clean energy and electrification of the automotive sector.\n\nThe Bear Case for Tesla Stock\n\nTesla’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and its margins could start to show acceleration, benefiting from improving the mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin - including FSD, supercharging, and Megapacks.\n\nHowever, short-term challenges, such as heightened competition and lower prices, may continue to squeeze Tesla's margins. Notably, increased competition in China, mainly from BYD (BYDDY), could exert pressure on the company's profitability.\n\nFurthermore, as Tesla’s margin gap with competitors narrows, its premium valuation becomes harder to justify - potentially limiting upside potential in 2024.\n\nWhat's the Bottom Line for Tesla Investors?\n\nGiven the near-term margin headwinds and expected decline in delivery volumes, analysts are not too bullish about Tesla stock in the near term. The consensus recommendation is now “Hold,” down from “Moderate Buy” a month ago.\n\nAmong the 28 analysts covering Tesla stock, seven have “Strong Buy” ratings, two recommend “Moderate Buy,” 15 have a “Hold,” and four suggest “Strong Sell.” Moreover, the average price target is $223.96, which implies relatively limited upside potential of about 16.8% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sneha Nahata did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The ETFs spent an estimated $141 million on shares, according to calculations by Bloomberg based on share closing prices.\n\nWood has been a long-time Tesla bull but had mostly sold shares for three straight quarters before the current buying streak. Her flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) — have Tesla as their third and sixth largest holdings, respectively.\n\nTesla has dropped 25% so far this month as the auto industry warns about plunging demand for EVs and Wall Street analysts scale back expectations for the stock. Wood’s flagship fund is down nearly 10%, but that’s after it gained 68% in 2023.\n\nTesla shares tanked after Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings report, when the company said it expected to expand at a “notably lower” rate in 2024. Following the results, Wood bought over 360,000 shares on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWood has been a long-time fan of Elon Musk’s EV company. ARK’s research team projects the stock will hit $2,000 in 2027, with Tesla’s robotaxi business a key driver. The investor often says her firm backs companies poised to change the world, and she has a five-year investment timeframe.\n\n“We think it shows conviction in the long-term story and we believe a lot of investors were waiting for a buying opportunity after TSLA shares more than doubled last year,” said Garrett Nelson, vice president and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “They are getting that opportunity now with the stock’s year-to-date selloff.”"}

Its earnings missed expectations and its shares experienced the biggest drop in over a year. The U.S. electric vehicle giant has been a big investor darling, with its shares doubling in 2023, but the company itself warned of a slowdown in 2024. Kingsley Jones, CIO and founder of boutique advisory firm Jevons Global, isn’t optimistic on the stock right now, thanks to rising competition from Chinese EV makers. He told CNBC Pro Talks on Thursday, “Unless Tesla can really expand their model range … and get their price down … then I think they are going to have a bit of a problem here because China’s going to be really eating away at their market opportunity outside of the U.S.” Tesla will probably face margin pressure in the United States if it doesn’t get both its prices and costs down, Jones added. Prefer BYD to Tesla Jones prefers Tesla’s Chinese EV rival BYD , which he says is his top EV pick. The stock has attractive valuations for its growth rate, Jones said. “This company is vertically integrated, and they control so much of their supply chain, including the batteries. So we think they’re pretty well positioned going forward,” he said. “I haven’t seen anything that would suggest to me that they don’t have sales momentum, business momentum, new model release momentum, and indeed, now export momentum,” Jones said. Earlier in January, data from both companies showed BYD dethroned Tesla in the fourth quarter as the top EV maker globally, and also surpassed Tesla’s production for a second straight year in 2023. BYD is now expanding aggressively overseas after dominating its domestic market in China. Like Tesla, it’s going beyond selling cars and manufacturing its own batteries and other components to stay competitive. Jones’ final word: “I’m a Tesla owner, I don’t own the stock. I own BYD instead, the stock – not the car. So I think that says everything in a way.” Two other EV alternatives Another EV company that Jones likes is Volvo Trucks, a unit under Swedish automaker Volvo . “The reason we like [electric] trucks is that it’s the area where Western manufacturers are still pretty strong,” he said. Volvo has a “very good” truck business, he said, adding: “In particular, they’re making a good transition in terms of electric trucks. So they’re probably one of the leaders in electric trucks worldwide.” He likes its “good business mix” of having sustainable biodiesel trucks and electric and fuel cell ones, he said. Finally, Jones flagged Chinese EV maker Nio as being “one of the leaders” in the highly competitive Chinese EV industry. He noted that it’s posting good sales numbers both domestically and overseas, and “worth having a good close look at.”"}

Late Wednesday, the company reported an adjusted profit of 71 cents per share on revenue of $25.17 billion, both short of analysts' expectations.1 Although total revenue grew 3% from a year earlier, Tesla said a global reduction in the average vehicle selling price stemming from price cuts in the second half of last year hurt the top line.\n\nThe company’s operating margin of 8.2% rose slightly on a sequential basis, but fell from 16% in last year’s corresponding quarter due to increasingly intense pricing competition from Chinese EV makers.2 \"If volume's going to be lower, then my guess is, (Tesla CEO Elon) Musk will probably cut prices and take share. Margins may continue to struggle for a while,\" Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, told Reuters.3\n\nTesla said in its earnings release that 2024 vehicle volume growth may be \"notably lower\" than last year due to a lull between its Models 3 and Y, which rolled off the production line between 2017 and 2020, and its next generation vehicle, which the company expects to start production at its Texas plant in the second half of 2025. While Tesla didn’t quantify 2024 vehicle volume growth, Wall Street projects a figure of about 20%, representing a sharp fall from 38% last year.3\n\nTesla shares traded within a symmetrical triangle between late April and early December before staging breakouts on both sides of the pattern. More recently, a fall below the triangle’s lower trendline has occurred on lackluster share turnover, indicating no clear direction.

The market is oversupplied.\"\n\nOn price cuts, Jonas noted that reductions in China and Europe have already matched or exceeded his full-year forecasts. The analyst added that the recent moves in Germany came only days after it unveiled plans to suspend production owing to supply disruptions linked to attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea.\n\nTesla is likely to forecast 2024 deliveries of around 2.2 million vehicles, even as global EV demand continues to fade. (Photo by David Butow/Corbis via Getty Images) David Butow/Getty Images\n\nJonas also noted that fewer of Tesla's U.S. vehicles will be eligible for incentives linked to the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, owing to foreign-part-sourcing rules. He said global incentives were likely to weaken \"as governments reassess budgets\" in a slowing economy.\n\n\"We anticipate Tesla's 2024 outlook to be cautious on volume and profitability,\" Jonas wrote, citing \"tough sledding\" for the EV market that will offset the group's AI and robotics ambitions.\n\nJonas cut his price target on Tesla by $35, to $345 a share, while holding his overweight rating in place.\n\nTesla shares were marked 2.2% lower in late Monday trading to change hands at $207.59 each, extending the stock's six-month slump to around 22.85%.\n\nAnalysts expect Tesla to post a bottom line of 74 cents a share, down around 38% from the same period in 2022, with revenue rising 5.1% to $25.56 billion.\n\nIt's all in the (profit) margins\n\nTesla's gross margins, which Wall Street closely tracks given Musk's recent focus on market share over profits, are likely to narrow to around 17.7%, according to Wall Street forecasts, compared with levels of around 25% over the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nInvestors will also focus on the group's 2024 delivery outlook, following a record 2023 tally of around 1.181 million, with analysts expecting a target in the region of 2.2 million.\n\nShort interest — measuring bets that a stock will decline in price — in Tesla remains elevated at the highest levels on Wall Street, as well, suggesting a cautious backdrop ahead of Wednesday's earnings report.\n\nInvestors have placed bets against the group of around $18.52 billion, or 3% of the stock's entire float, according to recent data from S3 partners."}

Amazon (AMZN) disclosed earlier this month (Feb. 2) that the e-commerce billionaire will sell up to 50 million company shares over the next year, which could potentially boost his net worth to over $200 billion.\n\nBezos already sold 12 million Amazon shares worth about $2 billion on Feb. 7 and Feb. 8, according to a company filing to the SEC on Feb.9. All 50 million shares would be worth over $8 billion, depending on Amazon shares’ market price.\n\nIt’s unclear why Bezos is selling such a large chunk of Amazon equity. He owned 988 million Amazon shares worth about $170 billion (just shy of 10 percent of the company) at the end of 2023, according to Amazon 2023 proxy statement.\n\nOn Bloomberg’s real-time billionaires rankings, Bezos currently sits behind Musk by a thin margin of $9 billion. The Amazon founder is worth $200 billion, while the Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO is worth $209 billion. Bezos was the world’s richest person from 2017 (overtaking Bill Gates) to 2021 before being dethroned by Musk. French luxury mogul Bernard Arnault, who owns the fashion and beauty conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF), also often traded places with Musk and Bezos in the top ranks.\n\nThe majority of Bezos’s and Musk’s wealth is tied to stock of their respective companies. The recent slump of Tesla’s share price and the sharp rise of Amazon is giving Bezos an opportunity to surpass Musk.\n\nSince the beginning of 2024, Tesla stock is down more than 24 percent, costing Musk about $20 billion in paper wealth. Over the same period, Amazon stock is up 15 percent, adding $23 billion under Bezos’s belt.\n\nBezos stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021 while remaining as the company’s board chairman. He has been moving about $1 billion a year to fund his space company, Blue Origin, and expanding his philanthropic efforts since then."}

Meanwhile, there were reports that Tesla won't roll out the \"Project Juniper\" Model Y refresh in 2024. TSLA stock fell Monday.\n\nX\n\nThe base Real Wheel Drive Model Y is getting a $1,000 discount, to $42,990, but the new owner must take delivery by Feb. 29. The All Wheel Drive Model Y also has been reduced by $1,000, to $47,990. The Model Y Performance remains unchanged at $52,490. Those are before federal tax credits of $7,500.\n\nWhile the Tesla Model Y discounts officially end after Feb. 29, it's possible that they could be extended, or made permanent. Tesla typically ramps up incentives at the end of the quarter. On Feb. 8, Tesla revived an offer to let Full Self-Driving owners to transfer their FSD rights to a new Model 3, Y, S or X, with delivery taken by March 31.\n\nAlso, Model Y inventories are relatively high in the U.S, even with Tesla's Austin plant running far below capacity. Tesla already discounts Model Y inventory by more than the temporarily lowered list price, so it's not clear how much the list price discount will boost demand.\n\nIn January, Tesla cut China prices modestly for the some Model Y variants as well as the Model 3, followed up by larger Model Y price cuts in Europe.\n\nEV demand generally is slowing. On Friday, Rivian (RIVN) cut the prices of its base-model R1T pickup and R1S SUV by $3,100, to $71,700 and $76,700, respectively.\n\nTesla Model 3\n\nTesla isn't cutting U.S. prices on the new \"Highland\" Model 3, with production limited at the Fremont plant. In fact, Tesla raised the price of its Model 3 Long Range by $1,000 to $56,990 on Feb. 4.\n\nThe Model 3 is no longer eligible for the $7,500 tax credit, due to tougher battery sourcing guidelines. That means it's often substantially cheaper to buy a Model Y than a Model 3.\n\nNo 'Juniper' Model Y in 2024?\n\nIn a related note, Tesla sent an email to delivery advisors on Saturday that a Model Y refresh won't be coming to North America in 2024, according to the Teslarati blog. The \"Project Juniper,\" a modest refresh along the lines of the \"Highland\" Model 3, had been expected to launch sometime this year.\n\nSeparately, local Chinese media said the Model Y won't get a facelift in China this year either.\n\nSome potential Model Y buyers around the world. may have been holding out for a \"Juniper\" refresh.\n\nTesla Shanghai began making the Highland Model 3 in third-quarter 2023, with deliveries starting in China and Europe in Q4. The Fremont just began making the refreshed M3 for North America several weeks ago.\n\nElon Musk Ordered To Testify\n\nA federal court in California on Saturday ordered Tesla CEO Elon Musk to comply with an SEC subpoena regarding possible violations of securities laws related to his 2022 Twitter purchase. The two sides must meet within a week to decide on a date and location for Musk's testimony.\n\nMusk disclosed his initial Twitter purchases past the legal deadline, as well as stating that the investment was passive.\n\nTesla Stock\n\nShares fell 2.8% to 188.13 on Monday.\n\nTesla stock rose 3% to 193.57 last week, reversing higher from its worst levels in nearly nine months.\n\nRivian stock fell 2.1% to 16.33 Monday, as Barclays downgraded the EV startup to Equal Weight, citing a broad slowdown for electric vehicles.

Even mighty Tesla said its vehicle-production volume growth would be \"notably lower\" than in 2023. At 35% year-over-year growth last year, vehicle production was already lower than the 50% growth target Tesla has been aiming for.\n\nNumerous headwinds have arisen. For Tesla, it's higher interest rates (which is making financing a new car more difficult for many consumers) as well as being in the midst of a transition to new vehicle models (like Cybertruck). For automakers in general, the higher interest rate environment is pairing with their own desire to manage near-term profitability, and so some legacy automakers are choosing to prioritize hybrid vehicles alongside their newer EV models.\n\nIt all adds up to a slowing EV market for 2024. But that doesn't mean growth is washed up. In fact, there could be a top stock that could win no matter how this market shakes out: ON Semiconductor (ON 0.15%).\n\nArrows-Out Expand NASDAQ: ON ON Semiconductor Today's Change (0.15%) US$0.12 Current Price US$80.92 Arrow-Thin-Down YTD 1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y +252.29% Price VS S&P ON Key Data Points Market Cap $35B Day's Range US$80.68 - US$83.43 52wk Range US$61.47 - US$111.35 Volume 6,575,283 Avg Vol 7,187,833 Gross Margin 46.44% Dividend Yield N/A\n\nOnsemi adds to the \"slowing EV market\" chorus\n\nOver the last few years, On Semiconductor (also known as \"Onsemi\") has redirected its portfolio of power management and sensor chips to automotive and industrial end markets. Automotive and industrial sales were 80% of Onsemi's $8.25 billion in 2023 revenue, up from 68% of the $8.33 billion in sales in 2022.\n\nIncluded in that total auto business was $800 million in silicon carbide (SiC) chips, a key ingredient in EV powertrains, and $1 billion in image sensors (used in advanced driver-assist systems). SiC in particular rocketed higher from about $200 million in sales in 2022 as Onsemi has reprioritized extensive portions of its manufacturing capacity to these next-gen power chips.\n\nMotley Fool Returns Market-beating stocks from our flagship service.

Some semiconductor suppliers are forecasting a double-digit-percentage sales decline during the first couple of quarters of this year. Onsemi itself isn't immune. Fourth-quarter 2023 sales were down 4% year over year, and the outlook for the start of 2024 implies about a 5% year-over-year decline.\n\nAgain, it all comes back to the suddenly slowing consumer-demand environment for EVs, especially in those aforementioned SiC chips that help power an EV. Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury said on the earnings call:\n\n\"While market reports still project 30% or 40% growth for silicon carbide in 2024, OEM's latest EV plans indicate a more tapered growth signaling a SiC market growth in the range of 20% to 30%. We still expect to grow at 2x the market growth in 2024 with customers ramping production in both industrial and automotive.\"\n\nEV or hybrid, Onsemi wins\n\nHyperfocusing on slowing EV demand, and in particular the slowing rate of growth for SiC chips tied to EVs, misses the bigger picture. EV demand is still on the rise, just not as fast as it was in the last few years. And many automakers are also selling lots of hybrid vehicles. Onsemi's portfolio is tilted toward selling chips to both types of drivetrains. El-Khoury mentioned on the earnings call that Onsemi's 2023 chip sales to hybrid models doubled from the year prior, while actual hybrid-vehicle sales climbed just 30%.\n\nAnd as for Onsemi's sluggish revenue, do bear in mind it is once again outperforming its peers during this industry slump. That means it's taking market share. The longer-term guidance is still in force, with full-year 2027 revenue implied of at least $13 billion (up some 60% from 2023), with gross-profit margin on product sold rising to 53% (compared to 47% in 2023).\n\nThis kind of growth and profit-margin expansion can add up to a great long-term investment. It has certainly worked during the last few years.\n\nAt this juncture, Onsemi stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 16x. If a resumption of growth from the EV market, and next-gen autos in general, looks imminent in 2024, this could be a top long-term bet on the whole industry."}

The stock doubled in 2023, but has tumbled by 25% in just the first six weeks of the new year.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why investors have been selling Tesla shares recently. Because of that drop, though, the stock was recently at its lowest level since last spring. It now makes sense to look at what sent Tesla stock falling below $200 per share, and whether this is a good opportunity for investors to buy it.\n\nArrows-Out Expand NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Today's Change (-2.81%) -US$5.44 Current Price US$188.13 Arrow-Thin-Down YTD 1w 1m 3m 6m 1y -10.09% 5y Price VS S&P TSLA Key Data Points Market Cap $599B Day's Range US$187.28 - US$194.73 52wk Range US$152.37 - US$299.29 Volume 95,498,597 Avg Vol 115,204,512 Gross Margin 18.25% Dividend Yield N/A\n\nBenefits of an EV growth slowdown\n\nTesla hit its electric vehicle (EV) production target in 2023, resulting in 35% growth over 2022. Most of the 1.8 million EVs delivered by Tesla were the Model Y SUV -- the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally last year. But there were signs of slowing growth in overall EV demand as the year progressed.\n\nInterest rates are one reason. During Tesla's third-quarter conference call with investors in October, CEO Elon Musk specifically noted, \"If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder for people to buy the car. They simply can't afford it.\"\n\nFast-forward to the company's fourth-quarter call late last month, when Musk began to look at the potential gains from a cycle of interest rate cuts that many expect to start this year. \"We have lots of people who want to buy our car but simply cannot afford it,\" he said. \"And so ... as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops, then they're able to afford it and they buy the car.\"\n\nMotley Fool Returns Market-beating stocks from our flagship service.

Join Stock Advisor Cumulative Growth of a $10,000 Investment in Stock Advisor Calculated by Time-Weighted Return since 2002. Volatility profiles based on trailing-three-year calculations of the standard deviation of service investment returns.\n\nAnother advantage Tesla has gained from the deceleration in EV demand growth is that large competitors like Ford and General Motors have throttled back their EV production plans. Ford CEO Jim Farley told investors his company is rethinking its vertical integration plans for EV and battery production. Should EV demand growth reaccelerate, that will once again give Tesla an advantage on costs. That could lead to a rebound in Tesla's sinking profit margins via increases in average selling price (ASP). That would be something investors would cheer. After all, even after it repeatedly cut its vehicle prices last year, the company still generated $4.4 billion of free cash flow after spending for future growth.\n\nSolar and energy storage\n\nAnother thing investors may start paying closer attention to is the growth in Tesla's energy business. Its energy storage segment grew by more than 130% in 2023. That increase in deployed Megapack storage capacity and energy generation resulted in revenue of more than $6 billion last year.\n\nThat's a meaningful number, and on the conference call, Musk expressed optimism that growth is here to stay. \"I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted,\" he said.\n\nThe Elon Musk factor\n\nOwning any stock comes with risks. But Tesla's unpredictable CEO has brought some additional risks to the company an investment. Musk has expressed a desire to own more of the company so that he can have more control over the direction of its efforts in artificial intelligence technologies. But a shareholder recently won a lawsuit that nullified the nearly $56 billion pay package for Musk that Tesla's board approved in 2018.\n\nThat has heightened concerns surrounding Tesla's corporate governance and raised questions about the outlook for board or leadership changes. If Musk decides to focus on one of his many other major projects, the stock would likely take a hit.\n\nFor those who can stomach those added risks, though, Tesla's recent dip below $200 per share might present a tempting opportunity to gain exposure to this multifaceted EV leader. If EV growth continues, even at a slower pace than before, Tesla is positioned to be the biggest beneficiary in the coming years."}

For all his flaws, Musk has been (mostly) a winner, creating two extremely valuable companies and continually defying the critics. Between March 2020 and November 2021, Tesla Inc.’s stock price shot up by roughly 1,600%, allowing Musk to gloat mercilessly over the large contingent of Wall Street investors who’d been shorting the stock. In July 2020, Musk even launched a mock-product, a pair of satin “short shorts,” to celebrate.\n\nLately though, Tesla has been one of the stock market’s biggest losers. Since the beginning of the year, the company has dropped about $200 billion in market capitalization, making it the single-worst performing stock on the S&P 500. The spiral has come amid a storm of negative headlines—especially regarding slowing growth in electric vehicle purchases—a category Tesla has long dominated. The company has also lost market share to China’s BYD Co. Worse for Tesla, some of the most negative headlines were ones caused by Musk’s own erratic decisionmaking.\n\nTo discuss why Tesla’s stock is falling and what it might mean for Musk’s larger empire, we brought in senior reporter Esha Dey, who covers stocks for Bloomberg. Among the highlights from this week’s episode:\n\nTesla’s big stock drop doesn’t seem quite so bad when viewed in the context of its recent performance. Tesla is unusually volatile and doubled in value in 2023, after losing 65% of its value the previous year. Still, a 30% drop over the course of a little more than a month is pretty bad, even by Musk standards.\n\nPart of Tesla’s problem is that even now it’s widely seen as overvalued. In terms of price-to-earnings ratio, it’s worth more than other big tech companies and far more than any competing automaker. That’s at least partly due to investors feelings about Musk, who has been able to spin a story of near unlimited growth potential.\n\nBut those stories aren’t as convincing as they once were. Tesla is years behind on the promise that its cars would soon be converted into money-making robotaxis. And Musk’s claims of Tesla’s AI prowess have been undermined by the prospect that he might develop artificial intelligence tech outside of Tesla. (We discussed this on last week’s emergency podcast.)\n\nSurprisingly, one key factor propping up Tesla’s stock price might be Musk himself. Tesla investors have tended to see Musk as a unique force who can ensure that Tesla has far more potential than a normal car company. If Musk left, Tesla’s growth promises would likely seem even less credible than they do now.\n\nMusk’s open use of recreational drugs, which the Wall Street Journal reported had caused some within Musk’s inner circle to suggest he go to rehab, has created additional uncertainty. According to the Journal report, Larry Ellison, a Tesla board member and close friend of Musk, invited him to Hawaii to “dry out.” Musk has denied the allegations.\n\nMusk’s alleged drug use has not been a secret, and many Tesla investors see such unconventional behavior a necessary ingredient in his success. But insiders’ fear that Musk has become self-destructive could eventually cause investors to rethink their beliefs.\n\nIf that happened, the consequences for Musk’s other companies, including SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink, could be severe. Musk has long used his vast wealth—currently $200 billion—to finance his other ventures. As he becomes poorer, that might make self-financing more difficult, not to mention any future weed-themed social media impulse purchases.\n\nTranscript: Is Tesla a Car Company, Tech Company or ‘Weird Amalgamation?’\n\nAbout the show: Each week, listen in as host David Papadopoulos (and sometimes Joel Weber) convenes a panel of Bloomberg journalists who are tracking Elon Musk’s companies and the surprising ways they intersect, breaking down his latest moves and what it could mean for us all."}

Stocks are posting tepid gains this week even after experiencing a sell-off on Wednesday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he likely does not see interest rates being cut in March. Week to date, the S & P 500 is now higher by 1% along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average . The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 0.8% this week. That said, there are some beaten-down names that may be due for a rebound. Using the CNBC Pro Stock Screener tool, we screened for the most overbought and oversold names in the S & P 500 based on their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks with a 14-day RSI greater than 70 are considered overbought, meaning they could be at risk of a pullback. A high RSI is often associated with investors getting too upbeat about a stock’s near-term performance. Conversely, stocks with a reading lower than 30 typically means they’re oversold and possibly gearing up for a short-term bounce. A low RSI typically indicates poor sentiment around a stock. Here are some of the most oversold names: Tesla , which saw its stock more than double in 2023 on strong delivery numbers and revenue from its automotive and energy divisions, is now struggling to sustain momentum. The EV company has cut prices and warned of “notably lower” vehicle volume growth this year, and during the fourth quarter, it lost its place as the top global EV seller to China’s BYD. Analysts have a consensus hold rating on Tesla, which has a 14-day RSI rating of 24.6. They anticipate about 14.5% potential upside for the company, which would signify a sharp reversal from its roughly 26.5% loss so far this year. Transportation and logistics company C.H. Robinson Worldwide is one of the most oversold companies in the S & P 500, scoring a 14-day RSI of 20.7. Shares of Minnesota-based C.H. Robinson are down 14.9% so far this year, and have lost more than 23% over the past 12 months. This week was rough for the stock, which fell after the company on Wednesday reported a sharp decline in its fourth-quarter profit amid a “poor demand and pricing environment” with weak levels of freight demand. Analysts, which on average have a hold rating on the stock, have an average price target that suggests shares could gain 10.3% from Thursday’s close. Energy tech services provider Baker Hughes was one of the few oversold names that analysts have a buy rating on, according to CNBC’s screen. Shares have fallen 15% since the start of the year, but analysts think the stock could jump about 42% over the next 12 months — the highest expected upside of the list. On Jan. 23, Baker Hughes beat earnings expectations for the fourth quarter but posted slightly disappointing revenue numbers for the period. The company’s 2024 guidance reflects strong EBITDA in the mid-teens range with slightly higher margins, according to FactSet. Other oversold names include United Parcel Service and the International Paper Company . There are also some names that could be due for a pullback. The following stocks are the most overbought in the S & P 500: Pharma giant Merck and Facebook parent Meta Platforms are among the most overbought stocks in the broad-based index, with each company having an RSI of about 86. Analysts have consensus buy ratings on both stocks. On average, however, analysts think Meta’s stock price could fall about 16% from its latest close and their forecast price target suggests Merck could gain just 0.7%. Meta’s stock price is up more than 34% so far this year, gaining more than 20% on Friday alone after the company announced its first-ever dividend and a tripling of its fourth-quarter profits. Given that shares of the big tech company also popped more than 175% in 2023, analysts think the stock could be due for a pullback. Merck shares have jumped more than 19% over the past 12 months. On Thursday, the company surprised analysts with stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings, driven by strong sales from its cancer drug Keytruda and HPV vaccine Gardasil. Of the overbought names, Boston Scientific has the highest potential upside according to analysts surveyed by LSEG, at about 9.3%. The medtech company, which has a consensus buy rating, has a 14-day RSI of 80.6. Payments giant Mastercard and insurance company Progressive are also among the most overbought companies in the S & P 500. Mastercard told CNBC on Thursday that it’s launching a new generative artificial intelligence model, Decision Intelligence Pro, which will allow banks to better detect and root out fraudulent transactions on its network in real-time.

Even Tesla bears agree on that. After all, Tesla's vehicle sales are growing much faster than Ford's. But what, exactly, should that premium be? And how fast will earnings grow in the coming years?\n\nOn these points, one analyst has an extremely different view from the rest of Wall Street. GLJ Research analyst Gordon Johnson's price target for the electric-car maker's stock is about 90% below where shares trade today, even though he's assigning a much higher forward earnings multiple to Tesla than to Ford. He just expects much lower earnings in the coming years, and a substantially lower valuation premium than the market is pricing in.\n\nArrows-Out Expand NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Today's Change (-2.81%) -US$5.44 Current Price US$188.13 Arrow-Thin-Down YTD 1w 1m 3m 6m 1y 5y +816.57% Price VS S&P TSLA S&P Key Data Points Market Cap $599B Day's Range US$187.28 - US$194.73 52wk Range US$152.37 - US$299.29 Volume 95,498,597 Avg Vol 115,204,512 Gross Margin 18.25% Dividend Yield N/A\n\nTesla stock: Worth less than $24?\n\nJohnson has a sell rating on Tesla stock and a 12-month price target of $23.53. He arrives at this price target by applying a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 15 to his estimate of Tesla's earnings in 2025, then discounting that price back to today using a 9% discount rate. This is actually a huge premium compared to the P/E that Tesla's peers Ford and General Motors trade at: The two auto companies have P/E ratios of about 5.\n\nHighlighting the difference between Johnson's view and the market's, Tesla now trades at 68 times trailing-12-month earnings. Trading at a P/E of 15 implies a significant contraction in this key valuation multiple. Also note that Johnson's forecast for Tesla's 2025 earnings per share is far below what most analysts are modeling. The consensus analyst forecast calls for Tesla's earnings per share to rise sharply, hitting a record $4.98 in 2025. Applying a price-to-earnings multiple of 15 to this and discounting it back by 9% would result in a fair value of about $63 today.\n\nWho is right?\n\nWith the average analyst price target currently sitting at about $227, Johnson's extreme view is at least worth some consideration. The difference between Johnson's approach and Wall Street's valuation of Tesla shows how much the growth stock depends on the market's high hopes for continued rapid growth -- both from electric cars, and from other segments like battery storage, solar, and vehicle software. Living up to its valuation will require massive growth from the company for the foreseeable future, both to drive earnings and to continue commanding a high valuation multiple.\n\nMotley Fool Returns Market-beating stocks from our flagship service.

Management regularly tells investors that it aims to grow vehicle production at a compound average annual growth rate of 50%. Since it set this target in 2021, it's exceeded this goal.\n\nBut recent growth has slowed substantially, with third-quarter production and deliveries rising 18% and 27% year over year, respectively. The company will need to accelerate its production and delivery growth to prove to Wall Street that investors should keep paying such a high multiple for the stock.\n\nThis should be a critical year for Tesla investors as they try to decide how likely the company is to return to substantially higher growth rates. If growth slows further, investors may need to revisit earnings forecasts and possibly lower the bar for what multiple they expect the market to assign to the stock. Time will tell whether earnings will be as disappointing as Johnson expects, but if they disappoint at all, then Tesla's P/E ratio could contract significantly."}

With that being said, let’s see if it is time to buy the recent pullback as earnings approach.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nDeliveries & Market Share\n\nTesla had 484,507 total deliveries during Q4 keeping the company in the running as the global EV leader with a stronghold on the domestic market ahead of competitors like General Motors GM and Ford F. Fourth quarter deliveries were up 19% year over year as Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3 remain the top-selling EVs in the United States ahead of General Motors' Chevrolet Bolt, Rivian’s RIVN R1T/R1S, and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E.\n\nTesla is thought to control just over 50% of the domestic EV market and posted total annual deliveries of just over 1.8 million EVs which represented 38% growth YoY.\n\nTesla Investor Relations\n\n\n\nImage Source: Tesla Investor Relations\n\nQ4 Financial Preview & Outlook\n\nDespite reporting another record for annual deliveries, Tesla’s Q4 earnings are projected to dip to $0.74 a share compared to $1.19 per share in the prior-year quarter. This may be indicative of Tesla’s price cuts and goal of a more affordable EV lineup as quarterly sales are projected to be up 6% to $25.94 billion despite the lowered profability.\n\nOverall, Tesla is now expected to round out its fiscal 2023 with annual earnings down -22% to $3.16 a share versus $4.07 per share in 2022. However, FY24 EPS is forecasted to rebound and jump 21% to $3.82 per share. Optimistically, total sales are anticipated to have climbed 20% in FY23 and are projected to expand another 20% this year to $117.47 billion.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla’s Valuation is More Reasonable\n\nFollowing the recent selloff in Tesla's stock, its 55.5X forward earnings multiple might still seem lofty but this is well below its decade-long highs and even 44% below its one-year high of 100.5X while at a 30% discount to the median of 79.9X.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlus, Tesla’s price-to-sales ratio is also contracting to be more reasonable and is currently at 5.7X compared to highs of 9.2X over the last year and a median of 7.3X.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nFourth quarter financial results will play a large part in the potential for more upside in Tesla shares but the EV pioneer remains one of the most intriguing growth stocks.

Efforts by traditional auto giants such as General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Volkswagen (VWAGY) also get coverage. However, Tesla and BYD stand apart.\n\nIn 2022, China EV and battery giant BYD's vehicle sales raced ahead of Tesla's. For all-battery electric vehicles (BEVs), BYD seized the crown in Q4 2023.\n\nTesla reported a big earnings drop in Q4 2023 and warned of \"notably lower\" delivery growth in 2024, with few positive catalysts before 2026.\n\nBYD reported weaker-than-expected preliminary Q4 earnings, as price cuts likely took a toll.\n\nOverseas sales are a key area of growth and margins for BYD, which just announced its entry into Indonesia and plans to build a plant there.\n\nTesla stock had a strong 2023, but peaked in July. Shares tumbled below key levels to start 2024, with Tesla cutting prices in China and Europe and other negative news. The EV maker is struggling to grow with profit margins that are now in line with traditional automakers. But TSLA stock is not valued anything like a traditional automaker.\n\nBYD stock has fallen sharply in recent months amid price war concerns. The start of the year is seasonally slow for China EV sales, and competition is intense there for BYD, Tesla and everyone else.\n\nMore broadly, signs of slowing EV demand around the world is weighing on EV stocks generally.\n\nTesla and BYD shares have come off recent lows, but not by much.\n\nLet's take a look at BYD vs. Tesla, as well as BYDDF stock vs. TSLA stock.\n\nJoin IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live\n\nTesla Vs. BYD Sales\n\nTesla delivered 484,507 EVs in Q4, beating analyst views of 480,463, according to consensus compiled by Tesla. Full-year deliveries hit 1.81 million, just topping the company's 1.8 million target. Credit strong China sales.\n\nMeanwhile, BYD on Jan. 1 announced record December sales of 341,043 EVs, including plug-in hybrids. Q4 sales hit 942,779, with full-year sales of 3,012,906, topping BYD's target of three million.\n\nNotably it sold 526,409 all-electric BEVs in Q4, up from 431,603 in Q3. That topped Tesla for the first time, and with a clear margin.\n\nIn January, BYD sold 201,493 EVs, up 33% vs. a year earlier but down 41% vs. a year earlier. Most EV makers reported sharp drops vs. December.\n\nOverseas sales were a bright spot, edging up to a new high. The premium Fangchengbao Bao 5 off-road vehicle and superpremium Yangwang U8 both did well.\n\nBYD is China's largest automaker. It was the world's 10th largest automaker in the first half of 2023.\n\nTesla Price Cuts\n\nTesla slashed prices worldwide in January 2023, with further cuts, big inventory discounts and other incentives since then.\n\nIn January 2024, Tesla cut Model 3 and Model Y prices in China modestly, after some token increases in the fall of 2023. Also in January, it reduced Model Y prices noticeably in several European countries, amid waning sales and reduced subsidies. However, on Feb. 12, it raised Model Y prices in some key European markets, though mostly still below where they were before the January cuts.\n\nIn early February, Tesla raised the U.S. price of its refreshed Model 3 Long Range by $1,000, with production still limited in the short term. On Feb. 10, Tesla cut prices on its first two Model Y variants by $1,000, but brand-new inventory is still discounted by far more.\n\nTesla Subsidies In 2024\n\nBack in the U.S., the first two Model 3 variants lost their $7,500 IRA credits as of Jan. 1 due to tighter battery sourcing rules. Tesla could adopt different batteries over time, but would likely be more expensive.\n\nGermany abruptly ended EV subsidies as of Dec. 17, cutting off a 4,500-euro environmental bonus. France ended subsidies for EVs made outside of Europe as of Dec. 15. That hits the China-made Model 3, but not the Berlin-made Model Y.\n\nCalifornia, a massive market for Tesla, has limited its EV subsidy to the middle class and poor.\n\nOn the plus side, Americans buying Tesla vehicles still eligible for IRA credits in 2024 get that credit at the point of sale, vs. via a tax return months later.\n\nIn the U.S. and Europe, consumers can often buy a Model Y for less than a Model 3.\n\nTesla Model 3 Revamp\n\nTesla unveiled an upgraded Model 3 in China on Sept. 1. The EV giant says its \"Highland\" Model 3, which boasted a higher price, has 9% longer range and various refinements.\n\nDeliveries in China and Europe started in late October.\n\nThe updated Model 3 is now available in the U.S. market, with only RWD and LR variants for now.\n\nIt's unclear if the modest changes, after six years, will revive the Model 3's fortunes beyond a short-term bump. Weekly registrations haven't shown strong Model 3 sales in China.\n\nMeanwhile, various reports said that the Model Y won't get a \"Project Juniper\" refresh in 2024.\n\nTesla Cybertruck\n\nTesla began deliveries in November. Two variants, the AWD Cybertruck and Cyberbeast, start at $79,900 and $99,990, respectively. For the next several months, Tesla is selling \"Foundation\" versions of the AWD and Cyberbeast variants, but for an extra $20,000.\n\nSome early owners have complained that the Cybertruck's battery range is far less than advertised. Tesla offers a \"range extender\" battery that takes up much of the truck bed.\n\nA base-model Cybertruck will start at $60,900, with a claimed 250-mile range, but won't be available until 2025.\n\nWhen the Cybertruck was first unveiled in 2019, Tesla said it would start at $39,900 with a top-variant range of 500 miles.\n\nOn the Q3 earnings call, Musk said that Tesla dug its own \"grave\" with the difficult-to-produce design. He added that it won't be financially positive for Tesla in the first year.\n\nThe Cybertruck is the EV maker's first new passenger vehicle since the Model Y launched in early 2020. But the Cybertruck is likely to largely be a North American vehicle, so Tesla may not have a new vehicle for most markets for several more years.\n\nIt's unclear if the Cybertruck had official deliveries in Q4.\n\nIn late 2022, Tesla handed over a few dozen Semi trucks to PepsiCo (PEP), but still hasn't declared any Semi deliveries yet, or revealed prices and actual specs.\n\nOther Vehicles\n\nTesla has teased a next-generation EV, but hasn't even shown images. It plans to build an EV plant in northeastern Mexico that will make that vehicle, but hasn't broken ground yet. On the Q3 earnings call, Musk suggested he wouldn't go \"full-bore\" on the Mexico plant until the interest-rate and economic climate is more favorable.\n\nOn the Q4 earnings call, Musk said he hoped to build the next-gen EV in the second half of 2025, though he admitted he's often \"optimistic\" about timelines. He reiterated that the small EV will first be made at the Austin plant.\n\nThe Austin plant would have higher labor costs, a key factor in typically low-margin small cars.\n\nMusk says Tesla will strip out costs in the new platform and use \"revolutionary\" manufacturing technique. However, Musk has tried to leapfrog industry factory productivity before without success. Lengthy delays, or worse, could result.\n\nA selling point for a made-in-Mexico cheap EV is that it could take advantage of low labor costs, limited U.S. competition and the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Obtaining IRA-compliant batteries would be crucial for the model's success in America.\n\nTesla Production\n\nTesla capacity has increased at its Berlin and Austin plants after significantly expanding its mammoth Shanghai factory last year.\n\nBut demand hasn't kept up with expanded output, even with Tesla slashing prices and curbing production well below capacity.\n\nTesla's European sales weakened as 2023 wore on, a problem that may continue with the loss of key subsidies there. That may mean even fewer Tesla Shanghai exports to Europe.\n\nTesla suspend production at its Berlin plant from Jan. 29-Feb. 11. It cited parts shortages due to Red Sea shipping delays, but there's no doubt that Tesla has excess inventory and capacity in Europe.\n\nBYD Expansion\n\nBYD is ramping up EV and battery production, with more China plants coming on line. It's already building an EV factory in Thailand, set to begin production in mid-2024. BYD has announced it will build an EV plant in Brazil, Hungary and now Indonesia.\n\nBYD launched several new models in 2023, across a wide array of prices. The small Seagull, starting at around $10,700, has been a big hit.\n\nBYD's upscale Denza brand has expanded from the D9 minivan in late 2022 to the N7 crossover and N8 SUV.\n\nBYD's super-premium brand Yangwang began U8 deliveries in late 2023, with a U9 supercar set to launch soon. BYD's FangChengBao brand has also started deliveries of the Bao 5, with more models to come this year.\n\nBYD is expanding massively overseas. Thailand has become a big market, but it has entered most of Asia. It's the No. 1 EV seller in Israel and has entered Europe. BYD is making a big push throughout Latin America, especially Brazil\n\nBYD began led its export push primarily with the Atto 3 small SUV, but is adding the Dolphin and Seal to many markets, with many more in 2024.\n\nExports are still a small share of sales, but have skyrocketed from almost nothing in mid-2022. Notably, BYD is generally selling EVs overseas at higher prices than at home, boosting margins even after shipping and other related costs.\n\nBYD's first PCTC ship provides a new boost for overseas sales, with several more to come.\n\nBYD has said it has no plans to enter the U.S. market for personal vehicles, though it does build EV buses in Lancaster, California.\n\nFive Best Chinese Stocks To Watch Now\n\nTesla Vs. BYD Batteries\n\nTesla traditionally has not mass produced its own batteries. For lithium-ion batteries, its joint venture partner Panasonic makes the cells and Tesla packages them. It also buys lithium-ion batteries from South Korea's LG. Tesla also has bought lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China's CATL.\n\nTesla is working on 4680 batteries, first touted at the 2020 Battery Day.\n\nThe 4680 batteries are standard lithium-ion chemistry, but the larger form factor offers the potential for various benefits and cost savings. Tesla's 4680 production has picked up output in recent months, but is still relatively low.\n\nAlso, more than three years after the much-hyped Battery Day, Tesla hasn't solved key technical hurdles to allow for 4680 mass production and cost savings. It's also not clear if some of the battery benefits are coming to fruition.\n\nLimited 4680 battery production could affect Cybertruck output.\n\nTesla recently reduced the estimated range substantially on key Model Y variants, as well as the Model S and X, following new EPA testing rules. The new estimates are more in line with real-world experiences with Tesla drivers. The Justice Department has been investigating whether Tesla exaggerates battery range.\n\nBYD, meanwhile, is one of the world's largest EV battery makers. Its Blade batteries are a specialized LFP. BYD is ramping up battery plants to supply third-party EV makers as well as storage, above and beyond its own EV needs.\n\nIn fact, Tesla uses BYD battery packs for a Model Y variant at its Berlin plant.\n\nBYD, like CATL and some others, is working on sodium-ion batteries. Those could be useful in smaller EV vehicles as well as for energy storage.\n\nThere is buzz that BYD will unveil an updated Blade battery in 2024, as well as an upgraded hybrid system.\n\nBoth Tesla and BYD are expanding in battery storage for home and business applications or utility-scale projects, though Tesla gets its batteries from CATL. BYD also teamed up with South Korea's LG for storage in North America and Europe.\n\nTesla's Other Businesses\n\nTesla has its own Supercharger network in its markets. That's especially important in the U.S. and countries like Australia, where third-party charging facilities are limited.\n\nTesla has struck deals with Ford, GM, Rivian and others to give those automakers' EV customers access to Superchargers in the U.S. They'll also adopt Tesla's charger standard soon. Those deals, and some related charging subsidies, will provide a nice boost to revenue. But they will reduce Tesla's charging moat in the U.S., which encouraged people to buy Tesla EVs\n\nTesla also has a solar installation business, but it's been struggling.\n\nTesla's self-driving ambitions continue. Autopilot and Full Self-Driving help bolster Tesla's image of cutting-edge technology, while FSD is a key source of revenue and profit, especially in the U.S. However, even FSD Beta remains a Level 2 driver-assistance system vs. a Level 4 or 5 fully autonomous system.\n\nTesla recently \"recalled\" Autopilot via an over-the-air software update to improve driver monitoring. That came as part of an ongoing NHTSA probe into Autopilot crashes.\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters said a review of documents showed that Tesla knew of faulty suspension and steering parts across its model lineup going back at least seven years, but often blamed drivers when those parts failed.\n\nBYD Other Businesses\n\nBYD, notably, makes its own chips. That, along with the in-house batteries and other vertical integrations, helped BYD expand rapidly in the past two years as many rivals struggled from chip and other supply shortages.\n\nThe EV and battery giant also has solar operations.\n\nBYD will introduce at least Level 2 driver-assistance systems in its Yangwang and Denza vehicles, as well as some BYD-brand EVs, over the next year. Level 2 systems, many with Lidar, are increasingly common in China, especially in premium models.\n\nRolling out quality Level 2 systems will be a priority for BYD's brands in the coming year, as that's increasingly becoming standard in mainstream and entry-level premium vehicles in China.\n\nBYD detailed its autonomous driving efforts at a Jan. 16 event, disclosing massive R&D spending and staffing. It's rolling some Level 2 systems, starting with premium models, but with mainstream models set to get them over the next year.\n\nBYD Co. is largely known for its BYD Auto operations. BYD Electronics, which accounts for an increasingly smaller share of overall revenue, is involved in mostly low-margin businesses such as smartphone components and assembly.\n\nIn late December, BYD Electronics closed its $2.2 billion deal for the mobility business of Jabil (JBL). That will boost the unit's exposure to Apple (AAPL).\n\nTesla Earnings\n\nTesla earnings plunged 40% to 71 cents a share while revenue grew just 3.5% to $25.2 billion. Both slightly missed views.\n\nOngoing price cuts have propped up vehicle demand, but at the cost of margins.\n\nTesla gross margin fell to 17.6% from 17.9% in Q3 and 23.8% in Q4 2022.\n\nAuto gross margins ex regulatory credits rose, slightly beating forecasts.\n\nOperating margins rose 8.2%, breaking a long slide to 7.6% in Q3. It was 16% in Q4 2022. That's in the normal range for traditional automakers.\n\nThose margins improved with some cost reductions, but Tesla's CFO said those savings have largely run their course. That suggests that ongoing price cuts will continue the downward pressure on Tesla's once-mighty margins.\n\nTesla gave little indication of deliveries, other than to say 2024 growth would be \"notably lower\" than in 2023.\n\nAnalysts, who have been slashing Tesla estimates since the end of 2022, now see 2024 EPS down 1% vs. 2023's $3.12.\n\nBYD Earnings\n\nBYD earnings have been booming, but faced some headwinds in Q4 amid significant discounting.\n\nOn Jan. 29, BYD reported preliminary 2023 net income of RMB 29 billion ($4 billion) to RMB 31 billion. That's up 74.5%-86.5% vs. 2022 but below estimates for some RMB 31.5 billion.\n\nThe preliminary full-year results imply Q4 net profit of RMB 7.6 billion yuan to RMB 9.6 billion, up 4%-31% vs. a year earlier but down from RMB 10.4 billion in Q3.\n\nBYD may not release full Q4 and 2023 figures until late March.\n\nBYD's Q3 gross margin was 22.1%, the highest since Q3 2020, with BYD Auto's gross margin surging to 25.7%. But Q4 preliminary figures suggest that margins took a big hit.\n\nTesla Stock Technicals\n\nTesla stock surged 102% in 2023, according to MarketSmith analysis. It's down 24.3% so far in 2024 as of Feb. 1,2 rebounding from a nine-month low in late January.\n\nShares plunged to their lowest levels since May followed the weak earnings and 2024 growth outlook. But TSLA stock had already been weak to start the year amid price cuts and Hertz (HTZ) announced it was slashing its EV fleet, mostly made up of Tesla vehicles, citing weak demand and high repair costs.\n\nThe relative strength line recent hit its lowest levels in a year.\n\nBYD Stock Technicals\n\nBYD stock climbed 12.7% in 2023. Shares are down 12.9% in 2024 through Feb. 12, rebounding slightly from a 52-week low at the end of January.\n\nThe EV giant hit a 52-week high of 36.27 on July 31, but has trended lower since then amid concerns that the China EV price war will hit sales and profits.\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has been a longtime major investor in BYD. But Berkshire has sold slices of its H-shares in BYD, starting in late August. The latest was disclosed on Oct. 31. Berkshire still owns about 5% of BYD, based on all share classes, but has halved its stake.\n\nTesla Vs. BYD Market Cap\n\nTesla stock has a market cap of $599.1 billion as Feb. 12, well off its peak above $1 trillion. That's still far above BYD's $65.8 billion.\n\nWith Tesla margins now more like a traditional automaker, and with growth constrained for the near future, Tesla stock has a high valuation for its EV-led operating businesses. Much of Tesla's valuation is clearly based on hopes that Musk will achieve breakthroughs in self-driving, robotics and AI.\n\nBYD stock is listed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, and only trades over the counter in the U.S. That also means the BYDDF stock chart shows a lot of minigaps.\n\nTesla Stock Vs. BYD Stock\n\nBYD sells far more EVs than Tesla and now has grabbed the \"BEV\" title. More broadly, BYD in many ways is the EV maker Tesla has claimed or aspired to be. BYD makes its own batteries and chips, and sells those batteries to third parties such as Tesla. Musk has talked about making a $25,000 Tesla; BYD makes EVs profitably at far below $25,000.\n\nWith Tesla no longer \"production constrained,\" it's shifted to price cuts to support demand.\n\nBYD has expanded in several big markets, and that is key to its efforts to be a global auto giant. Its model lineup continues to expand dramatically, with big moves upscale.\n\nTesla has begun Cybertruck deliveries, but significant shipments won't occur for several months. Musk has said the vehicle will be a financial drain in 2024. A next-generation vehicle may not arrive until 2026 or later, and making money on small EVs is difficult\n\nTesla stock doubled in 2023 but has been trending lower in recent months, with sharp losses to start 2024.\n\nBYD stock, meanwhile, has plunged on China EV price war concerns.\n\nBoth EV giants are delivering far more electric vehicles than rivals. Tesla profits tumbled in 2023. BYD earnings growth remains strong, though it cooled late last year.\n\nSo keep your eyes on BYD and Tesla, as well as Tesla stock vs. BYD stock.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on X/Twitter at @IBD_ECarson, Threads at @edcarson1971 and Bluesky at @edcarson.bsky.social for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks\n\nIBD Digital: Unlock IBD's Premium Stock Lists, Tools And Analysis Today\n\nU.S.-China Tech Cold War Heats Up As Beijing Returns Fire\n\nThese Seven Stocks Lead Earnings Wave; What To Do Now"}

The problem, of course, for Tesla is six\n\n00:12 of those seven tech companies benefit from that enthusiasm.\n\n00:16 While EV demand is expected to slow in 2024, making it hard for investors to\n\n00:20 swallow the sky high valuation for Tesla.\n\n00:23 Let's bring in Danny Lee, then, who follows this company very closely for\n\n00:26 us, joining us out of Hong Kong. Hong Kong.\n\n00:27 Danny, Tesla's had a tough start then. It's 2024, but the stock is down about,\n\n00:31 what, 2/10, a little over 20, 20%, I should say.\n\n00:34 2/10 would be would be fine. I think Elon Musk would take that, but\n\n00:36 down about 24% year to date whilst the likes of Mazza and of course and video\n\n00:42 are notching up gains of what, 30 40% so far just just this year.\n\n00:46 What are investors saying then about the potential for carving Tesla out of this\n\n00:50 grouping? Yeah.\n\n00:53 As you say, Tesla's had a pretty tough start to the year.\n\n00:56 It's the only Magnificent Seven stock under water right now.\n\n01:00 And so when you look at the the broader, broader gains across the Magnificent\n\n01:06 Seven, you know, Tesla's had a really tough start and it's really all down to\n\n01:10 the other magnificent six. So your apple Amazon matter Nvidia\n\n01:16 they've all benefited from having this attraction investors see in artificial\n\n01:21 intelligence. Now Tesla doesn't quite have that and\n\n01:24 really with you know EV growth slowing in one of its key markets such as the\n\n01:30 US, investors are clearly looking away and thinking really it's quite doubtful\n\n01:36 that valuations are sky high.\n\n01:38 Valuation currently around 600 billion can hold.\n\n01:43 So, Dani, what are the Tesla bulls saying in terms of their optimism for\n\n01:47 the business? Can Tesla turn a turn around this slump\n\n01:50 that it had a very good year last year? Year to date, though, of course it has.\n\n01:54 It has that face that pressure. We are focused on that longer term\n\n01:57 slowdown in terms of the growth of EVs. Is there silver linings here?\n\n02:01 What is it that there's going to be a pivot point for Tesla potentially?\n\n02:06 Yeah, I mean, just look at 2023, right? When Tesla shares were up 100% after\n\n02:12 that earnings, the full year earnings Elon Musk had given just recently\n\n02:17 warning about notably slower growth and also not giving a guidance for 2024.\n\n02:22 That really shocked investors given how well they performed over 2023.\n\n02:26 And so that already has started to hit the stock hard.\n\n02:29 And and we've all these negative concerns about not just EV growth in the\n\n02:35 US but also some of like China which is another key market.\n\n02:38 That's really how the stock and what I would characterize 2024 being as a year\n\n02:42 of transition as it waits for the likes of a cybertruck to ramp up in production\n\n02:47 and to start delivering in earnings or so that it's got a new cheap EV under\n\n02:52 under development that's going to come in late 2025.\n\n02:55 This is all not going to help in some way like 2024 when they're investing\n\n03:00 more and sales is not going to match up to the heady heights of 2023 in terms of\n\n03:04 growth. So therefore, investors are clearly\n\n03:08 looking now when you look at the valuation right now and given how high\n\n03:11 it was, over 900 billion at one point and last year and beyond that, you know,\n\n03:16 when I look at valuations now coming down, how far lower can it go\n\n03:23 down? You're sitting there in Hong Kong, you\n\n03:25 touch on the Chinese market. The importance of the Chinese market in\n\n03:28 the US market for Tesla's prospects is the bigger is the bigger challenge for\n\n03:32 Tesla in China the competition or is it the broader macroeconomic weakness that\n\n03:38 we're seeing in China? Just the fact that consumers are more\n\n03:41 constrained in terms of their spending, or is it a combination of the two?\n\n03:44 What is your assessment and says the prospects for Tesla in that market?\n\n03:49 I think we have to wait and see how, for example, the Lunar New Year plays out.\n\n03:53 We saw the first month of a monthly sales data and it was lower across the\n\n03:58 board for all the EV plays. And there is, yes, rising competition,\n\n04:01 but also as what Tesla executed last year in terms of price cuts that really\n\n04:08 has shaken up the market. And you see other emerging stronger\n\n04:11 players willing to challenge China's Tesla financially.\n\n04:15 And so therefore, you know, Tesla does have a strong competition.\n\n04:19 But when you have consumers really rethinking or thinking about sales in\n\n04:24 the world's biggest auto and EV market, that does put some pressure on someone\n\n04:28 like Tesla, which has built in the expansion of capacity to capture this"}

Tesla reported adjusted EPS of $0.71 against $0.73 expected. Adjusted net income totaled $2.48 billion against the $2.61 billion expected by the Street.\n\nIn terms of its full-year production, Tesla said its \"vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas,\" indicating it would not reach Street estimates of 2.19 million for 2024, which would have been a 21% increase from 2023.\n\nTesla stock has lost more than 26% this year.\n\nOn a call with analysts, CEO Elon Musk did confirm that the company's next-gen vehicle will be coming in the second half of 2025. In its earnings release and later on the earnings call, Tesla also mentioned progress on its next-gen manufacturing platform.\n\n\"We are focused on bringing the next-generation platform to market as quickly as we can, with the plan to start production at Gigafactory Texas,\" the company said. \"This platform will revolutionize how vehicles are manufactured.\"\n\n\"We're very far along on our next-gen low-cost vehicle. We're really excited about this. This is a revolutionary manufacturing system, far more advanced than any other in the world,\" Musk said on the earnings call, clarifying that the company's current schedule has this vehicle hitting production in the second half of 2025. This echoes a report from Reuters earlier Wednesday that said Tesla told suppliers it wants to start production of a new mass-market EV codenamed \"Redwood\" in mid-2025.\n\nTesla's drop in profitability is likely due to downward pressure on margins since Tesla began its cost-cutting efforts late in 2022. Tesla reported a Q4 gross margin of 17.6% vs. 18.1% estimated, a big drop compared to a year ago and a sequential decline from the 17.9% achieved in Q3.\n\nStory continues\n\nHeadlines like rental car firm Hertz shedding thousands of EVs, Tesla cutting prices in China, a two-week production halt in Berlin, and CEO Elon Musk's ill-timed demand for more stock have also weighed on Tesla.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries in Q4, beating Street estimates of 483,173, per Bloomberg. That figure represents an all-time record quarter for Tesla, nearly 20,000 units higher than its past record quarter of 466,000 units delivered in Q2 of last year.\n\nFor the year, Tesla said that vehicle deliveries grew 38% year over year to 1.81 million and production grew 35% year over year to 1.85 million. While its 38% delivery growth rate was below its 50% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) target, Tesla previously said it would not attain that goal due to factory shutdowns and improvements that occurred in Q3.\n\nAlso of note are Cybertruck deliveries. Tesla did not break out this total in its Q4 delivery update, though the company did say the Cybertruck production ramp would take longer than other models.\n\n\"[Cybertruck] demand is off the hook,\" Musk said on the call, repeating similar comments that made last year.\n\nTesla's new Cybertruck is shown on display at a Tesla store in San Diego, Calif., Nov. 20, 2023. (Mike Blake/REUTERS/File Photo) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nMusk also addressed his comments from last week, claiming that he would need to secure greater control of Tesla if the company is going to meet its wide-reaching AI ambitions.\n\nMusk said on the earnings call that his concern would be, given his current shareholding, that he will have \"so little influence\" in the future that some major shareholder could strip away his control or make a bad decision.\n\nElon Musk is speaking at the symposium about antisemitism, organized by the European Jewish Association, in Krakow, Poland, on Jan. 22, 2024.

Here’s what it will be:\n\nElon Musk is going to ask Tesla Inc.’s board of directors to change its state of incorporation from Delaware, which just invalidated Musk’s $55 billion pay package, to Texas, which loves Musk and is begging him to move and would probably let him pay himself whatever he wants. Tesla’s board is going to be like “sure yes of course, whatever you want.” Then Tesla will ask shareholders to vote to approve the relocation, as Musk has already said it will do. Some shareholders will sue Tesla, asking a Delaware court to stop Tesla from moving. They might win?\n\nIt cannot really be the case that a Delaware court can stop any Delaware corporation from moving its state of incorporation to Texas. But it might be the case that a Delaware court could stop Tesla from moving to Texas.\n\nToday the Wall Street Journal has a story previewing this news:\n\nThree powerful shareholders are trying to loosen Delaware’s long-held grip over public companies. Tripadvisor, under media executive Greg Maffei, wants to reincorporate in Nevada, over the objection of minority shareholders. Billionaire Barry Diller is awaiting a ruling that could relax Delaware’s scrutiny of transactions like the 2020 split of some of his online businesses. And Elon Musk, who reincorporated Twitter as X in Nevada last year, has said he would ask shareholders about reincorporating Tesla in Texas.\n\nThe stuff about Musk and Tesla and Texas, sure. But I want to focus on TripAdvisor, because that is the real preview of what could happen with Tesla. TripAdvisor Inc., and its parent company, Liberty Tripadvisor Holdings Inc., are Delaware public companies that are run and controlled by Greg Maffei, who has supervoting stock and does, uh, fun stuff with his voting power. He gets sued by shareholders sometimes, and apparently wanted to reincorporate his companies to Nevada to get sued less: Nevada’s corporate law seems to be friendlier to corporate officers and controlling shareholders, with “broad protections for directors and officers in many cases that Delaware wouldn’t, including involving improper personal gain,” according to the Journal.\n\nAnd the companies’ boards of directors considered moving to Nevada, and the directors decided it was a good idea, and they asked shareholders to vote to approve the move, and the shareholders approved. Well, Maffei approved, and he has supervoting shares; a majority of the independent shareholders voted against the proposals to move, but they passed anyway.\n\nBut some shareholders sued to stop Maffei from doing this. Here is their complaint. The argument is essentially:\n\nUnder Delaware corporate law, a company’s board of directors and controlling shareholder have fiduciary duties to the ordinary shareholders, and they can’t do something — even something otherwise legal, like reincorporating to Nevada — if it violates their fiduciary duties. Where the board and controlling shareholder have a conflict of interest — where they get something from a transaction at the expense of ordinary shareholders — then Delaware will review the transaction for “entire fairness”: The transaction is a breach of fiduciary duties, and so not allowed, unless the court finds that it is “entirely fair” to the ordinary shareholders. Maffei and his board of directors get something out of moving to Nevada (they get to not be sued for doing creative stuff with their control of the companies), and this comes at the expense of the ordinary shareholders (they don't get to sue if Maffei does creative stuff to them). But the ordinary shareholders were not compensated for this, and voted against it, and the board did not have a special committee of independent directors to consider the move: It just did what Maffei wanted. So the move is surely not “entirely fair” to them. So a Delaware court can and should stop TripAdvisor and Liberty TripAdvisor from moving to Nevada, so that Delaware can continue to keep an eye on Maffei for the benefit of the ordinary shareholders.\n\nAnd that kind of is how Delaware law works. In fact, this is more or less the same reasoning that a Delaware court applied last month to strike down Musk’s pay package:\n\nTesla’s directors — and Musk, who the court found is the “controlling shareholder” of Tesla even though he doesn’t own supervoting shares or a majority of the stock — have fiduciary duties to Tesla’s ordinary shareholders. Conflicted transactions need to be entirely fair to those shareholders. Musk got something out of his pay package (options worth more than $55 billion), at the expense of ordinary shareholders (who got diluted). The ordinary shareholders did actually vote to approve the pay package, but the judge found that their vote was not fully informed. And the judge found that the pay package wasn’t entirely fair to shareholders — basically, Musk wasn’t worth what he was paid — so she blocked it.\n\nAnd Maffei doesn’t really argue against this framework. Instead, his lawyers argue that there is no conflict of interest here, because Maffei and the directors want to move to Nevada for good corporate governance reasons, and they aren’t getting any personal benefits. From their motion to dismiss:\n\nPlaintiffs ask this Court to do something that has never been done before — prevent a corporation from leaving the state of Delaware notwithstanding its undisputed compliance with the provisions of the [Delaware General Corporation Law] that allow the corporation to do so. Section 266 of the DGCL gives corporations the right to leave Delaware and reorganize under the laws of another jurisdiction. Plaintiffs seek to limit that right, if not do away with it altogether. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that where, as here, a corporation decides to move from Delaware to a state that potentially provides officers and directors with greater protection from future litigation based on conduct that has not yet occurred — and thus claims that do not yet exist—the Court should enjoin the move as a breach of the directors’ (and, in this case, an alleged controller’s) fiduciary duty.\n\nBecause there’s no conflict, Maffei argues, the Delaware court should defer to the board’s business judgment rather than conduct its own review of the fairness of moving to Nevada:\n\nPlaintiffs theorize that the Directors were conflicted because there might be future board decisions that might give rise to litigation claims and such claims might survive a motion to dismiss in Delaware, but not in Nevada. As explained below, Plaintiffs’ speculation is too hypothetical and remote to constitute a unique benefit today. The Amended Complaint does not allege any existing or even inchoate litigation claim that the Conversions would extinguish. Plaintiffs’ hypothesized conflict arises from the mere possibility that the Boards might take some unidentified action in the future—after the Companies have moved to Nevada — that could give rise to a future stockholder claim. But the risk of a future unknown stockholder claim is one every board faces and is not sufficient to require entire fairness review, much less prevent a corporation from electing to move to another state. … The Amended Complaint does not contain factual allegations supporting a reasonably conceivable inference that the Directors or Maffei have a financial interest in the transaction or that Maffei would obtain some unique benefit from the Conversions.\n\nAnd that’s reasonable. But later this year, when we talk about Elon Musk moving Tesla to Texas, he won’t be able to make that argument. He will have a very very clear financial interest in the transaction: A Delaware court just struck down his $55 billion pay package, and even before that he was going around posting that he wanted another enormous stock grant so that he can control at least 25% of Tesla’s stock. And if he can’t get it in Delaware, he’ll go to Texas.\n\nI am sure that, when Tesla actually asks its shareholders to approve reincorporating in Texas, it will have good lawyers write a proxy statement emphasizing the many corporate benefits of Texas, the importance of attracting and retaining talent and the value that Musk provides to Tesla. I don’t even think that will be wrong; I think there is something odd, and perhaps shareholder-unfriendly, about a Delaware judge striking down a pay package that Tesla’s board and shareholders thought was a good idea. I just think that Elon Musk is not the most carefully lawyered guy in the world in his personal statements, and he will have made — he has already made — a very clear record proving that he wants to move to Texas so that he can make Tesla give him $75 billion worth of stock.\n\nSo shareholders will go to the Delaware judge saying “Elon Musk tried to pay himself $55 billion, and you stopped him from doing that because it was unfair to shareholders, and now he is trying to move Tesla to Texas so that he can (1) get rid of you and (2) pay himself $75 billion, so you have to stop him again.” And I think that is an argument that the Delaware judge might find compelling? I mean, she did stop Musk from paying himself $55 billion. Presumably this move will be even more offensive.\n\nAnd Tesla is a Delaware corporation, so it is subject to the orders of the Delaware court, even if those orders are “where do you think you’re going? Get back here you little scamp!” And so maybe Tesla really can’t leave?\n\nAnyway, that’s the news from six months from now, and I suppose when it actually happens I will just write some comical imagined dialogue for Musk and say “see previous column.” There are some risks to this thesis:\n\nMusk could appeal the decision about his compensation and win, and then he might lose interest in moving to Texas. I kind of think that he’ll want to move even if he wins on appeal, though.\n\nMaffei could win such a comprehensive victory in the TripAdvisor case that nobody will even be able to argue that a court can stop Musk from leaving Delaware, so Tesla will just leave with no problem.\n\nMaffei could lose so comprehensively that Musk’s lawyers will tell him “you’ve got no shot at leaving Delaware, don’t even bother,” and he’ll believe them and give that up. I assign 0% probability to this one.\n\nMoving to Texas might be a thing that Musk posts about but does not actually plan to do?\n\nI don’t know; I think it’s gonna happen. Last week Musk moved Neuralink Corp., his brain implant company, from Delaware to Nevada, and he previously moved Twitter to Nevada (and renamed it X). Those deals were easy, though: Those are private companies with smallish groups of shareholders, none of whom are all that jazzed to sue Elon Musk, so he can kind of do what he wants. Tesla is different. It does make sense that Musk would want to pursue his next idea at one of his other, private, Nevada companies. He just has a lot more control over them.\n\nI said last month that “there is something awkward about a judge second-guessing the CEO compensation decisions of the board of directors of a $600 billion company, even if, yes, it’s the board of Tesla.” But that is nothing compared to how awkward it will be for a Delaware judge to prevent the company from leaving Delaware because Musk doesn’t like Delaware judges. It seems like the world can’t really work that way, that Delaware can’t really prevent its companies from leaving. And yet … maybe? It’s gonna be a fun time here at Money Stuff when it happens.\n\nMultistrategy\n\nI wrote the other day that Bill Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square LP, “is kind of what you think of when you think of a hedge fund.” But then I realized (in a footnote) that I needed to qualify that statement. I don’t know what you think of when you think of a hedge fund. I think there are two main models. There is what I think of as the old-school classic hedge fund, like Pershing Square, where one high-profile manager makes a handful of concentrated high-conviction market bets using his natural talent and hard work and market experience and gut instinct.\n\nBut then there is the newer model of multimanager, multistrategy hedge funds, or “pod shops,” like Citadel or Millennium or Point72, that have a bunch of different portfolio managers each making bets in some particular sector or strategy. Unlike the old-school managers, the pod-shop portfolio managers don’t usually go on television that much.\n\nAlso unlike the classic funds, the pod shops are run on, as it were, scientific lines. I mean, the portfolio managers might trade on gut instinct, but they are managed scientifically. Each portfolio manager will generally be tasked with producing returns that are not correlated with the broader market or the sector she invests in: The consumer discretionary manager won’t get a bonus just because consumer discretionary stocks do well; she’ll only get paid if she buys the best consumer discretionary stocks and shorts the worst ones. She will be required to be more or less factor-neutral, to run a portfolio that makes money on the strength of her ideas rather than on broad market trends. And her bosses will have quite sophisticated techniques to measure her performance and her skill, to neutralize standard market factors and to extract only alpha, only the returns to skilled investing.\n\nThe appeal of the multimanager funds, to institutional investors, is obvious: They can offer true alpha, true uncorrelated returns. They can tell allocators: “Okay, you can get your stock-market exposure from stock index funds, your bond-market exposure from bonds, your real estate exposure from buying real estate, whatever, and then you can diversify your portfolio by putting some money into our fund and we’ll just pay you 12% per year with very little volatility.” This is not a pitch that appeals to everyone: Plenty of people want the charismatic gut-instinct-driven single manager who might put all her money on one big bet that returns 300%. But it is a pitch that appeals to sober, sensible institutional asset allocators with a lot of money.\n\n(Incidentally, one model of why Ackman is launching a public closed-end fund designed to appeal to US retail investors now is precisely that institutional investors increasingly want the scientific multimanager model, and the classic charismatic-manager model is maybe a bit outdated. But it’s still popular with retail investors on Twitter/X!)\n\nThere is, however, a downside for investors from all of this scientific management. The downside is that the multimanager funds might get too good at scientifically analyzing performance, and at attributing it to skill. The fund manager might be able to say something like “okay this portfolio returned $47 million last year, of which $13 million is attributable to the analysts’ research, $14 million to the portfolio manager’s stock-picking, $11 million to our firm’s risk management and $9 million to our investors’ capital.” And then the investors get the $9 million and the fund manager and analysts and portfolio manager get the rest. If you get too good at measuring the returns to investment skill, you might, uh, pay all of those returns to the people whose skill generated them? And what does that leave for investors?\n\nBloomberg’s Nishant Kumar and Liza Tetley report:\n\nThe priciest multistrategy hedge funds are now keeping most of the profits they generate, while clients shoulder their costs. Clients received 41 cents of every $1 made by multistrategy funds that passed on all their costs last year, according to a survey by the prime brokerage unit of BNP Paribas SA. Their share is down from 54 cents in 2021, reflecting a startling new reality where the most popular funds effectively have a blank check for expenses. These funds outperformed peers, and most of the wider industry, on investment returns. However, gains measured after fees are the lowest among multistrategy funds, the poll of 238 allocators managing or advising on $1.2 trillion in hedge fund assets found.\n\nYes, right, in the olden days a charismatic manager would take big swings on a handful of stocks and would make a lot of money. Nobody would be sure — or would even ask — how much of the returns were due to the manager’s skill and how much were just, like, the stock market went up. But the crude compromise would be that the manager paid herself 2% of assets and 20% of profits and the investors got the rest. In modern multimanager funds, the fund can say “well 59% of this performance is clearly attributable to our skill so we’re keeping it.”\n\nMeanwhile it’s not all great for the portfolio managers either. At Business Insider, Bradley Saacks reports:\n\nFormer Point72 president Doug Haynes is looking to revive a strategy he previously ran for billionaire Steve Cohen for his new fund launch. The quantamental strategy — which blends fundamental stockpicking and algorithm-based number crunching — was internally known at Point72 as Idea Lab while under Haynes and then eventually became Latitude before shuttering in 2020. … It's an alpha capture-type strategy in which 12 West Palm Beach-based analysts will come up with investment ideas, and a systematic algorithm will create a portfolio based on the ideas and analytical tools that focus on position sizing and risk management. The firm — which hopes to raise $1 billion — has \"substantial investor interest,\" according to a spokesman for the firm, and is set to launch on April 1.\n\nIf your scientific management determines that the analysts add most of the value and that the portfolio managers can just be automated away, that’s what you do.\n\nMore cell phones\n\nI guess if you ran a business and you invented some new product that you knew would prove essential to every employee of every investment bank, asset manager and other financial services firm, you might start by selling it to the big banks. The big banks have lots of money and can afford your product, winning their business will validate your product in the eyes of smaller firms, and you just get a lot of bang for your marketing buck: Big banks have thousands of employees, you probably price your product by the seat, and so you can get a lot of money by selling to a large company. But later, after you saturate that market, you will move on to other, smaller firms. Eventually you’ll get around to charging a two-person hedge fund for two copies of your product. There’s still money to be made.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission does various things, but one thing that it does these days is charge financial services firms large fees for using mobile phones. I mean, it doesn’t provide the phones or anything. But the SEC has developed a theory that it is illegal for employees of securities brokerages and investment managers to use WhatsApp or personal text messages to talk about work, and it has applied that theory retroactively to fine firms whose employees did that. And since, as far as I can tell, every single employee of every single securities brokerage and asset manager has at some point at least texted their boss to say “hey sorry I’m running late for this meeting,” the SEC can more or less fine every financial firm for doing this. It’s not exactly a flat per-seat fee, but the fines do seem to scale with the size of the firm.\n\nAnd the SEC did start with the big banks, because (1) they’ll pay the biggest fines and (2) extracting $125 million each from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, BofA Securities, etc. (and $200 million from JPMorgan) definitely validates the business model: If you run some small securities brokerage and the SEC comes to you with its hand out because you texted your colleagues, who are you to say no after Goldman paid $125 million? And then it moved on to smaller brokerages and investment banks, as well as credit rating firms, and is apparently also looking into hedge funds. The fines there are smaller — fewer employees, fewer phones, less money — but it’s a reliable business.\n\nAnd so last week:\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission [Friday] announced charges against five broker-dealers, seven dually registered broker-dealers and investment advisers, and four affiliated investment advisers for widespread and longstanding failures by the firms and their employees to maintain and preserve electronic communications.\n\nThe firms include Northwestern Mutual, Lincoln Financial, Guggenheim Securities, a bunch of others; the fines ranged from $1.25 million to $16.5 million. There is no suggestion that anyone at any of these firms used their personal phones to do crimes, just that using their personal phones to talk about business is itself illegal. They’re gonna keep going with this. Eventually I’m going to be fined $12.95 for texting a colleague about my work.\n\nBill Ackman took the FT’s ‘Bill Ackman or American Psycho?’ quiz\n\n“I got a perfect score,” he tells Reeves Wiedeman at New York Magazine, in a profile that also features “a demon child named Ackman who harvests souls for the Great Demon King.” Also quoted in this profile: “There’s a meme going around that apparently I’m causing a lot of marriages to have trouble.” And: “I am an extremely fast writer, and I am powered by a profound love that is infinite.” And: “a WhatsApp group with probably 50 billionaires.” I hope they don’t talk about work.\n\nThings happen\n\nDavid Solomon Strengthens His Grip on Goldman Sachs.

CEO Elon Musk said the company was between two major growth waves, indicating that investors would have to be patient until new products help reaccelerate Tesla's growth rate.\n\nTesla's automotive revenue growth slowed to just 1% year over year, reaching $21.6 billion, and overall revenue grew just 3% to $25.2 billion. Additionally, profits continued to tumble, with gross margin slipping from 23.8% in the quarter a year ago to 17.6% in Q4 2023, and operating income fell 47% to $2.06 billion.\n\nWhile Tesla's growth has moderated significantly, the stock still retains a significant premium over other automakers. This is primarily due to expectations of coming disruptive technologies like full self-driving, its Optimus autonomous humanoid robot, and new car models, including a lower-priced offering and even \"robotaxi,\" a purely autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel.\n\nMusk made predictions about two of those initiatives, and either could be game changers for Tesla. Here's what he had to say.\n\nImage source: Tesla.\n\n1. Full self-driving could be coming this year\n\nFull self-driving has become something of a white whale for Tesla, as the company has been touting the technology for years, but it has yet to be fully deployed, though a beta version is available.\n\nFor many investors, full self-driving, or FSD, is the technology that will make Tesla a truly transformative company. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood envisions robotaxis with FSD technology contributing a majority of the company's profits as soon as 2030, just six years away.\n\nIt's unclear when Tesla will offer full self-driving, as there are technological, reputational, and regulatory hurdles. However, according to Musk's comments on the earnings call, it could be coming sooner than most investors think.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response to a question about other carmakers licensing FSD technology, Musk said, \"I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses. We've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet. I think that will become obvious probably this year.\"\n\nIt's not clear exactly what Musk is referring to when he says \"obvious,\" but it sounds like the company is on the verge of making it clear that FSD is real and functional. He also said he was interested in hosting another AI day later this year, so investors should expect to learn more about the timeline for FSD, and could even see a release sometime in 2024.\n\n2. Tesla's next-gen vehicle is coming in 2025\n\nTesla has also been teasing a mass-market vehicle for years as well, and investors finally got some information regarding that launch.\n\nIn response to a question about moving production of the next-generation vehicle platform to Austin, Texas, Musk said, \"Our current schedule says that we will start production toward the end of 2025, so sometime in the second half. That's just what our current schedule says.\" Musk also acknowledged that he's \"often optimistic regarding time,\" a tongue-in-cheek reference to his earlier delivery promises that came up short. For example, the Cybertruck was originally slated for delivery in 2021, but it finally rolled out late last year.\n\nMusk has said time and again that competing on price is key to the company's long-term growth and market share gains, and introducing a mass-market vehicle that could be priced around $25,000 is a cornerstone of that strategy. The Tesla chief also added, \"We're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle,\" and he called the manufacturing system involved \"revolutionary.\"\n\nAn affordable Tesla vehicle that could compete with the likes of a Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic could be a game changer for the company, especially if it performs significantly better than similarly priced vehicles.\n\nWhat it means to Tesla investors\n\nTesla did not give guidance for 2024, but it seems likely to be a lost year for the company, barring a major announcement with full self-driving. Still, the stock's recent pullback seems to adequately reflect the business's near-term weakness.\n\nIf the company can deliver on FSD and the next-gen vehicle, the stock should be a winner over the long term. Of course, Musk's comments on the timeline aren't a guarantee by any means, but the potential of another disruption from Tesla should help put a floor on the EV stock, barring further declines in its profit margins or negative revenue growth.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
