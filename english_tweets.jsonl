They even go as far as blaming customers for not wanting EVs and would prefer gas cars. They are right about not wanting EVs because they don't want THEIR EVs. They want a $TSLA. \n\nThe reason why are they coming up with this story is because legacy automakers can't make profitable EVs. They also can't seem to scale. In this space, it's all about scale and scaling comes with demand for your products and THEN profits. Something that $TSLA and BYD have achieved.\n\nIt's crazy to me that $F's profit margin is for EVs are -98%! How the fuck is that even possible, I have no idea but it is. A company like $F that apparently suppose to be one of the leading EV makers today can't seem to make money with their EVs. So instead, it's easier to turn around and tell everyone that no body wants EVs and that everyone wants a gas car. It looks like Ford is learning that prototype are easy but production is hard for EVs!\n\nIt's sad to see this because the future is clearly EVs and the data supports that 10 fold.\n\n2. Compact Car\n\nThe compact car is going to take $TSLA to new levels. Imagine buying a brand new Tesla for $25k or lower. Some countries have incentives and so you can probably get one below $20k. INSANE!\n\nThis new generation vehicle will cut $TSLA's COGS per vehicle in HALF. Therefore, if ASP today is $36k, we should expect the COGS of the compact car to be around $18k. That's a SHEESH moment. \n\nBut here's the crazy part where I go like WTF:\n\nA vehicle that's priced around $40k became the world's best-selling vehicle (Model Y). According to Ark, a vehicle that's priced ~$40k has a maximum of 5% of the addressable market. A vehicle that's priced around $25k can take up to 50%, A 10X! Therefore if $TSLA sold over 1.2m Model Y's in 2023 and that's 5%... Then the compact car has the potential sell 10X that amount, around 11.2m! What the actual fuck! ü§Ø\n\nThe compact car will change the game forever.\n\n3. FSD \n\nFSD V12 is already out to some customers and will be rolling out slowly to all FSD customers in North America. After some updates, FSD is apparently not going to be beta in the US meaning any $TSLA drivers can opt in for FSD which is EXTREMELY bullish. If this happens, I expect $TSLA to add \"FSD Software\" or \"Software\" revenue/profits onto their income statement. This will allow WS and other analyst to project revenues/profits for this \"new\" income stream and will give a boost to $TSLA stock.\n\nBut forget about that for a second because we know FSD is going to continue to progress in the US. What's crazy is FSD beta will finally be entering Europe (2025) and China (unknown date). THIS is insane because now the software will slowly enter new parts of the world further increasing $TSLA's revenue/profits. What's INSANE about this is that once FSD is approved and regulated in those respected country, all Tesla has to do is one software update to ALL $TSLA vehicles to enable any Tesla driver to opt in for FSD. THIS is when Tesla will start printing money OVERNIGHT! This is the part where no one sees or believes. This is the part when $TSLA will have a $NVDA moment.\n\nYou. Are. Not. READY!\n\nThere's also Energy, BOT, Superchargers, Semis and many other things that I didn't mention but the following points above is enough to take $TSLA to be worth TRILLIONS.

This will allow WS and other analyst to project revenues/profits for this \"new\" income stream and will give a boost to stock. But forget about that for a second because we know FSD is going to continue to progress in the US. What's crazy is FSD beta will finally be entering Europe (2025) and China (unknown date). THIS is insane because now the software will slowly enter new parts of the world further increasing 's revenue/profits. What's INSANE about this is that once FSD is approved and regulated in those respected country, all Tesla has to do is one software update to ALL vehicles to enable any Tesla driver to opt in for FSD. THIS is when Tesla will start printing money OVERNIGHT! This is the part where no one sees or believes. This is the part when will have a moment. You. Are. Not. READY! There's also Energy, BOT, Superchargers, Semis and many other things that I didn't mention but the following points above is enough to take to be worth TRILLIONS. This is why I keep buying the stock. in the long term is looking so good. All these short term noise is just that. Noise.
