When you start losing people like him, it surely... surely... should be some kind of reality check.  Elon argues that Chuck is ignoring the existential risk to American civilization. But I think the biggest risk to that civilization comes from unbridgeable political division, and Elon's latest provocations here are actually making the problem worse. There was a time, early in the Twitter/X takeover when Elon was arguing convincingly that the loudest voices where at the extremes, and he, along with 80%+ of America and the world did not share those opinions.\n\nBut now, to many of us, it seems that he's being pulled closer and closer to extreme opinion. In today's world, dismay and disgust are more powerful motivators than love and support. So this move can only be negative-sum in terms of Elon's overall influence. He is gaining a few new rabidly enthusiastic supporters. But losing far, far more. It's pretty heartbreaking to see.\n\nI really think this is a moment when those who care most about Elon - his friends, his family, board members, anyone he might listen to - need to step up and urge him to rediscover the possibility that people like Chuck have his best interests at heart.\n\nElon, I happen to believe you could be on the verge of achieving astonishing things with X. In many ways the platform has advanced under your ownership (Community Notes my favorite example). It continues to innovate at incredible speed, despite - or because - of having only a quarter of the workforce it had.  This is a genuinely incredible achievement and flies in the face of much of the snarking among progressives. \n\nBut I really think you're in danger of handing your enemies victory after all, just by making it harder and harder for anyone remotely in the center to listen to you.  You said something brilliant when you first took over this platform. You said you wanted to maximize unregretted user-minutes. This is exactly the right metric.  \n\nBut the tragedy right now is that for literally millions of people, the minutes they regret most when they come to X are... your posts.  It's not just what they say, nor their aggressive tone. It's the fact they come from you, the powerful owner of the platform.  To be clear, I'm not talking about all of your posts... there are still plenty featuring imaginative humor and exciting tech revelations.

Per Iv√°n, ‚ÄúLet me summarize‚Ä¶  at the end of last year, we already went through the Council and the incentives for Tesla were authorized‚Ä¶ Now what the state is working on is the infrastructure around the plant for when they are ready, which will be sometime in 2024‚Ä¶ I can say that we are in contact with them daily and the first stone of its plant will be in 2024. They will define the month for us, but it will be in 2024.‚Äù\n\n- Krishan Pal Gurjar, India‚Äôs Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries, reiterated that Tesla will not get preferential treatment and ‚Äòno separate policy.‚Äô In other words, no rollbacks on import duties, or any specific advantage that is not offered to other companies.\n\n- Today Panasonic Energy announced it struck a graphite supply agreement for its U.S. battery plants with Australian materials company Novonix. The agreement procures 10,000 tons of graphite from Novonix‚Äôs North American plants over four years, with shipments scheduled to start in 2025. Panasonic is supplier of Tesla.\n\n- Tesla accumulated $1.79 billion in regulatory credit revenue in 2023 per an annual That brings the cumulative total Tesla has received since 2009 to almost $9 billion.\n\n- Tesla approved adaptive headlights for the Model S and X in Europe.\n\n- Per Not a Tesla App, Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology (mostly iPhones) is now available for Phone Key.

Recovery boat Shannon pulled the capsule out of the water and the SpaceX crew helped the astronauts exit the vehicle. Everything appeared to be a perfect trip for the Axiom 3 crew.\n\n- Maybe Launch 12 today. At 4:34 p.m. PT., Falcon 9 Starlink 7-13 will launch from Space Launch Complex 4E (SLC-4E) at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The booster will land on droneship Of Course I Still Love You in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n- Super Heavy Booster 10 rolled out of Mega Bay 1 yesterday evening and made his way to the Orbital Launch Pad. It was a quick trip down Hwy 4. The chopsticks opened and gave Booster 10 a hug. At around 1:15 a.m. CT, B10 was lifted and placed on the OLM. Today they are tank farm testing!

HHO most probably, what else could it be? there is no current so no traditional electrolysis occurring. There are *no* industrial methods to produce HHO btw. \n\n4.

Dr. Guido Ebner and Heinz Sch√ºrch found that a static electric field will induce significant changes in the appearance & behavior of plants & animals, to the point of practically becoming new species.

If you hold the north pole of a magnet close to seeds, they will germinate slower, yielding smaller & weaker plants with poor taste. South pole has the opposite effect.

The concept, as it relates to plants, is called magnetoculture.\n\n8. Dr. Ian Stevenson found scientific evidence of reincarnation; he interviewed dozens of cases where small children recounted things from past lives that would be impossible to guess; family secrets, rare work skills, taste preferences. Physical damage in previous lives seemed to carry over into the reincarnation, mortal wounds often becoming a significant role. Memories of past lives are strong in childhood but later fades away, make sure you ask 2-3 year olds about who they used to be. My god-daughter remarked that she misses \"her old family\".
