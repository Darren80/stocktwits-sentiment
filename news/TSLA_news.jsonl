That’s more true than ever in 2024.\n\nWe recommended buying Tesla stock in January 2023, arguing, in part, that declines linked to Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, now called X, and electric-vehicle price cuts were overdone. That turned out to be a good call. Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock was up about 110% from that recommendation.\n\nNo one expected a double, but Tesla stock is one of the most volatile stocks in the market and led by an iconoclast. Shares rarely do what is expected. Being able to endure all that volatility is why nerves of steel are required. Now the question is whether to take the money and run or double down and bet on another big year.\n\nThe sell case is strong. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, who called Tesla a short in a December report, points out that this year’s earnings estimates fell by half, even as the stock doubled last year—an odd situation he sees reversing. He predicts weakening demand, a result of the fact that Tesla has only two cars widely available to buy, the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nAnalysts now expect 2.1 million vehicles to be sold this year, up less than 17% from 2023. That’s far short of Tesla’s goal to grow volume 50% a year on average. That growth bogey would have required Tesla to eventually sell 3 to 4 million Model 3 and Y vehicles a year, which is “completely unrealistic and unanchored in basic market sizing data,” says Sacconaghi, who has a Sell rating and a $150 price target on the stock.\n\nBut the bull case is also strong. Baird analyst Ben Kallo, who has a Buy rating on the stock, sees enough catalysts to drive Tesla’s shares to $300, up about 25% from Thursday’s close. They include a low-price model to help revive demand, a refreshed Model Y, falling raw material costs, and streamlined production. “We continue to view Tesla as the EV leader and recommend it as a core holding for our coverage,” Kallo writes.\n\nWho’s right? Perhaps neither. Many years ago a fund manager—a Tesla bull—explained the way he managed his position. When shares were beaten up, he would buy more stock up to about 5% of his portfolio value. When shares were soaring, he’d sell his position down to 2%.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThat seems sensible to us, and though we, too, are long-term Tesla bulls, we believe this is the time to be at the low end of the range. We already recommended selling up to half of our position in June, when the stock was trading above $250, leaving us with roughly our original stake. With shares still at similar levels, we see no reason to sell more.\n\nNow, though, everything hinges on the Model 2. Last quarter, China’s BYD sold more battery electric cars than Tesla mainly by selling cheaper vehicles. Tesla has one coming—it has already announced plans for a lower-priced EV—but when the car will arrive is still a guess. Collecting orders in late 2024 and seeing them on roads in mid-to-late 2025 is a reasonable guess.\n\nUntil then, we’re content holding what’s left of our theoretical position. It rarely pays to bet against the market leader, even one as volatile as Tesla."}

The short answer is not all that much. The decline probably comes down to taxes.\n\nTesla stock closed at $234.96, down $5.49, or 2.3%, in Tuesday trading, while the S&P 500 dropped about 0.2% and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.1%.\n\nShares of the electric-vehicle maker are down for seven of the past eight days, and have lost about 5.4% to start 2024, according to Dow Jones Market Data, while the Nasdaq has slipped about 1% year to date.\n\nTesla stock is weak despite delivering a record, and better-than-expected, 485,000 cars in the fourth quarter. That compares with about 405,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n“Tesla has seen an orderly pullback above its rising 200-day moving average, and it is now short-term oversold on neutral intermediate-term momentum,” says Fairlead Strategies founder, and market technician Katie Stockton External link .\n\nMarket technicians look at stock charts to get a sense of how investors feel about any stock and to help predict where shares will go over the short and medium term. Oversold essentially refers to a stock dropping far more than expected, with the bad news causing excessive damage. Such stocks are typically due for a rebound.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up The Barron's Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers. Preview Subscribed\n\nIn the case of Tesla, however, there isn’t much bad news. CEO Elon Musk was in the news about alleged illegal drug use, reported on by The Wall Street Journal. But Tesla stock rose 1.2% on Monday, the first day of trading following the article.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThe early 2024 action appears to be more about profit-taking to start a new year. Tesla stock more than doubled in 2023. Selling stock early in any new year avoids paying capital-gains taxes until the next tax cycle. Selling at the end of 2023 would result in gains hitting an investor’s current tax filing.\n\nAs for momentum, stock traders like to follow it because, essentially, stocks that are going up typically keep going up and vice versa. Stockton doesn’t see any big change in momentum trends. In fact, “the uptrend is intact,” she says. “Resistance is now about $260 initially, and I’d like to see it hold above the 200-day moving average.”\n\nThe 200-day moving average is about $231 a share. Tesla stock is still above that. Resistance for Stockton is where Tesla stock might stall out when the current trend reverses.\n\nThe next big fundamental data point for Tesla shareholders is fourth-quarter earnings, due to be reported on Jan. 24. Wall Street is looking for earnings per share of about 72 cents, according to FactSet, down from $1.19 reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. Tesla sold more cars in the fourth quarter, but price cuts have pressured profit margins. Any commentary from Musk about pricing or EV demand will be as, or more, important than the headline numbers his company reports.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue"}

In the U.S., rising labor costs and a decision by rental car company Hertz to sell off a large portion of its electric vehicle fleet also added to Tesla’s woes.\n\nReuters reported late Thursday that Tesla plans to suspend most production at its factory outside Berlin in Grunheide, Germany, from around Jan. 29 to Feb. 11 due to conflict in the Red Sea that has disrupted global trade.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Houthi militia group has been attacking cargo ships and merchant vessels in the Red Sea in response to the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip. These attacks have drawn condemnation from leaders around the globe.\n\n“The considerably longer transportation times are creating a gap in supply chains,” Tesla told Reuters in a statement.\n\nAnalysts at Baird estimate Tesla produces between 5,000 vehicles and 7,000 vehicles per week at its German vehicle assembly plant, which would imply “a 10k-14K hit” to deliveries in its first quarter, according to a Thursday note.\n\nThe Baird analysts wrote that they are “wary” of further effects to Tesla’s supply chain, and they are “closely monitoring” any effect on the company’s shipping routes from China. “No delays have been cited, however, we speculate that disruptions in the Red Sea may lead to longer wait times as supply chains are rerouted,” they wrote.\n\nAnalysts were also focused on Tesla’s continuing price cuts including new discounts in China. Morgan Stanley analysts noted Model 3 and Model Y vehicles have been freshly discounted, though the cuts were “more moderate than the market had expected,” according to a note Friday.\n\nPrice cuts over the past year have affected Tesla’s ability to keep selling its fully electric vehicles in high volumes to rental car companies including Sixt and Hertz .\n\nHertz CEO Stephen Scherr said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Thursday that his company is taking 20,000 EVs out of its fleet, which was comprised mostly of Tesla vehicles.\n\nHertz is trying to “bring supply in line with demand” Scherr said, and “addressing a cost issue related to the EVs in the context of damage and damage costs” as well as depreciation in the value of the EVs.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s business and reputation remains under pressure in Europe due to ongoing labor strikes in Sweden and throughout Scandinavia.\n\nAt its factories in the U.S., the EV maker is implementing pay rate increases for workers that kick in this month, a move seen as a tactic to stave off workers’ wishes to unionize. The pay bumps follow historic wins by the United Auto Workers in 2023 with Tesla competitors in Detroit, and an announcement by UAW that it would aim to organize beyond the Big Three including at Tesla, Toyota and others."}

It isn’t unprecedented, but it’s bad enough that investors should ask themselves what’s going on.\n\nTesla shares have fallen 12% to start the year. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both have been flat.\n\nThere are a few non-Tesla reasons investors might be selling. The U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield has ticked up ever so slightly to just over 3.94% from just below that. It’s a tiny change but reflects a hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reading that has shaken some investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will be cutting interest rates.\n\nLower interest rates can help stock valuations. They can also make cars cheaper to finance, helping Tesla and others sell more cars.\n\nThen there are taxes. Tesla stock doubled in 2023. Sometimes investors avoid selling until a new year to put off paying taxes until their next year’s tax filing. It’s the opposite effect of tax-loss selling in December.\n\nThat, like the change in the 10-year yield, also likely is just a minor factor. Tesla stock has risen 11 of the 13 full years that it has traded as a public company. The stock has dropped to start the next year in six of the 11 times. That is more than 50%, but not much of a trend.\n\nThis year isn’t the worst start to a year, however. It’s only the fourth-worst start. Tesla stock dropped more than 20% in the first nine trading days of 2012 after rising 7% in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nMore significant than trading patterns and rates are Tesla’s Chinese price cuts, implemented late this week. Lower prices for cars mean lower profit margins and lower earnings estimates from analysts. What’s more, lower prices in China will stoke speculation that prices for new Tesla vehicles will fall around the world.\n\nThere was also the announcement earlier this week that Hertz is selling one-third of its EV fleet. That stoked fears that Americans aren’t ready for EVs. It’s probably more accurate to say American car renters aren’t ready for EVs. It’s tough to take a rental EV on a road trip if the driver has little experience with an electric vehicle. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called the situation a black eye for Hertz, not Tesla.\n\nThe Hertz announcement came as Cox Automotive published full-year sales data for 2023. Americans bought 1.2 million battery-electric vehicles last year, up 45% year over year.\n\nAmid the selling of Tesla stock, ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood has been buying. She bought 94,733 shares of Tesla in the ARK Innovation ETF on Jan. 11, and 93,654 on Jan. 12.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nARK didn’t return a request for comment from Barron’s on Saturday. ARK is a Tesla bull and the stock is the second-largest position in the fund, next to Coinbase, representing about 8% of the portfolio. Wood just might be buying the dip.\n\nAs for when the selling might end, investors can look at the stock charts. Tesla took out “its 200-day moving average, which increases risk to the next move and more important support near $208,” said Fairlead Strategies co-founder and market technician, Katie Stockton. Technical analysts such as Stockton look at stock charts and patterns to get a sense of investor sentiment and where stocks will go over the short and medium term.\n\nTesla stock’s 200-day moving average is about $231 a share. It closed below that level on Thursday for the first time since November. Stocks sometimes have trouble dropping below or rising above significant moving averages. That’s a technical analysis observation that can reflect when investors feel like a stock has gotten too cheap or too expensive.\n\nWhen a key level is taken out it can signal a change in investor thinking. Investors, in this instance, are looking more worried about EV pricing, competition, and the direction of interest rates."}

Tesla stock was down 8.6% in premarket trading Thursday, below $190 a share, after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 71 cents a share. Wall Street was looking for 73 cents a share.

Late Wednesday, the company reported an adjusted profit of 71 cents per share on revenue of $25.17 billion, both short of analysts' expectations.1 Although total revenue grew 3% from a year earlier, Tesla said a global reduction in the average vehicle selling price stemming from price cuts in the second half of last year hurt the top line.\n\nThe company’s operating margin of 8.2% rose slightly on a sequential basis, but fell from 16% in last year’s corresponding quarter due to increasingly intense pricing competition from Chinese EV makers.2 \"If volume's going to be lower, then my guess is, (Tesla CEO Elon) Musk will probably cut prices and take share. Margins may continue to struggle for a while,\" Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, told Reuters.3\n\nTesla said in its earnings release that 2024 vehicle volume growth may be \"notably lower\" than last year due to a lull between its Models 3 and Y, which rolled off the production line between 2017 and 2020, and its next generation vehicle, which the company expects to start production at its Texas plant in the second half of 2025. While Tesla didn’t quantify 2024 vehicle volume growth, Wall Street projects a figure of about 20%, representing a sharp fall from 38% last year.3\n\nTesla shares traded within a symmetrical triangle between late April and early December before staging breakouts on both sides of the pattern. More recently, a fall below the triangle’s lower trendline has occurred on lackluster share turnover, indicating no clear direction.

Don’t blame recalls or Wall Street analysts—blame the rule of three instead.\n\nThe electric-vehicle make is coming off Thursday’s brutal selloff that sent its stock plummeting 12%, closing below $183. The electric-vehicle company’s lack of 2024 volume guidance and disappointing earnings call triggered the shares’ dive.\n\nTesla stock opened up 1.6% and traded to almost traded at almost $187 early on Friday, but receded to change hands at $183.93 for a 0.7% gain. The S&P 500 was up 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite was flat in midday trading.\n\nShareholders might hope for a big stock bounce after Thursday’s steep slide, and one might come, but not yet.\n\nThe “three-day rule has to run,” says Gary Black External link , cofounder of the Future Fund Active ETF, which holds Tesla.\n\nThe rule of three isn’t scientific. On Wall Street, it is essentially the length of time portfolio managers take to catch their breath after being punched in the gut. Instead of buying the dip, portfolio managers tend to let things settle and think for a minute.\n\nTesla stock, after a great 2023, hasn’t been kind to portfolio managers so far this year. The EV pioneer’s shares have underperformed the Nasdaq by almost 30 percentage points year to date—that’s bad news when many portfolio managers are judged based on relative performance to a benchmark. If they were overweight Tesla to start the year—meaning they had a higher allocation to the stock than the benchmark index did—they are already 1 or 2 percentage points in the hole, explains Black. That would give managers some pause before doubling down on an investment.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nTesla stock will be weak for a couple of days just because of that dynamic, Black expects. The rule of three is probably a bigger deal than other factors involving Tesla, including Wall Street analysts’ price target updates and the EV company’s vehicle recalls.\n\nThursday evening, Daiwa analyst Jairam Nathan cut his price target on Tesla stock to $245 from $280 a share, but kept his Buy rating. With a new, next-generation Tesla vehicle slated for the end of next year, he sees the “growth slowdown” extending into 2025.\n\nThe analyst cut his 2025 earnings estimate to $4.25 a share from $5.50. Wall Street is at $4.49 a share, according to FactSet, leaving Tesla trading for about 41 times estimated 2025 earnings.\n\nOn Friday, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman also cut his 2025 estimates and price target. His target goes to $130 a share from $135. His 2025 earnings estimates fell to $4.25 a share from $4.50. Brinkman maintained his Sell rating on Tesla shares.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nIn addition to the cuts, Tesla recalled some 200,000 vehicles, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s database. The problem is with the backup camera, and was fixed with a software update.\n\nRecalls—as Barron’s has written many times—usually don’t matter to the stock prices of automotive manufacturers. There can be exceptions, of course, when recalls are particularly costly or involve serious accidents. Those instances are few and far between.\n\nEven the recalls that feel like a big deal don’t always affect stock prices significantly. The 2020/2021 Chevy Bolt battery recalls —for potential battery fires—ended up being paid for by a General Motors supplier.\n\nThe 10 largest vehicle sellers in the U.S.—which include Tesla—recalled some 32 million cars in 2023. Tesla recalled 2.6 million units. More than 99% of the fixes for Tesla recalls were via over-the-air software updates.\n\nNot every manager follows the rule of three. ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood bought the dip in Tesla stock, snatching up some 178,000 shares in two funds on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue"}

Yes, that’s the crisis. That matters more than investors might suspect. There are things the auto maker can do to help offset the problem. It should do them fast.\n\nWalter Isaacson wrote about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’s RDF in his 2011 biography of the tech titan. An RDF has a way of making people within the field believe seemingly impossible things. Isaacson noted Musk is also an RDF generator in his 2023 biography of the EV pioneer.\n\nIn the case of Tesla, Musk’s RDF has convinced investors that Tesla is much more than a car company. It’s an “AI robotics company,” according to Musk—with his caveat that Tesla vehicles are simply four-wheeled robots.\n\nTesla needs to be more than just a car company because building cars is, frankly, not a very good business. It’s “capital-intensive, labor-intensive, competitive, regulated, cyclical, and low growth,” says Freedom Capital Markets auto analyst Mike Ward. He doesn’t cover Tesla stock. He’s just followed the auto industry for decades.\n\nA long time ago, in a period of lower competition, building cars was a good business. In the 10 years post-World War II, General Motors generated a net profit margin of roughly 8% while growing sales almost 15% a year on average. In the 10 years leading into the Financial Crisis—which pushed the company into Chapter 11 restructuring—GM generated an average net profit margin of 1%. Sales grew less than 3% a year.\n\nRecent vintage Tesla is akin to post-war GM. Since turning solidly profitable in 2020, Tesla’s profit margins have averaged about 13% while sales raced ahead by 45% a year. Now Tesla is facing margin and growth pressures. Wall Street projects average margins of about 10% for the coming three years while sales grow less than 20% a year on average. Automotive realities are sinking in.\n\nSteve Jobs, by the way, never faced industry dynamics like that. Since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, Apple’s net profit margin has averaged roughly 23%. Sales have expanded roughly 15-fold over that span. (RDF strength might be proportional to absolute profit levels.)\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nTesla’s solution to a fading RDF is better communication. Tesla simply cannot rely on Musk’s superlative statements to carry the day with investors any longer. (Musk has said Tesla can be the world’s most valuable company at least five times in the past 18 months.)\n\n“The [recent] conference calls have a Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus feel,” says Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. “It’s so frustrating.”\n\nHe isn’t alone in that view. “Bad communication is the issue,” says Future Fund Active ETF co-founder, and Tesla shareholder, Gary Black External link . “Quantifying notable lower revenue growth would [have helped],” adds Battle Road Research analyst Ben Rose.\n\nThis isn’t a call from a news outlet for Tesla to hire PR. The kind of messaging needed is consistency in demand forecasting, pricing, margins, product development, customer acquisition strategy, and market segmentation.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nOf course, Tesla can’t communicate all that effectively without having processes in place to manage all of those. That’s where communication intersects with business execution. Tesla needs to mature. Better communication would demonstrate to investors that Tesla understands the realities of the car business.\n\n“Unrealistic expectations were easier to [have] when they were the only game in town,” adds Ward. Tesla’s market share of U.S. battery electric vehicle sales in 2020 was almost 80%. Tesla finished 2023 with a 55% market share.\n\nThe good news for Tesla investors fretting about the 12.1% post-earnings drop is that Tesla stock always does that. Over the past decade, Tesla stock has dropped after earnings more than 23 out of 40 times. The average move, up or down, is about 8%. Tesla is volatile and prone to big moves.\n\nA bad quarter isn’t existential for the EV giant, but it is an opportunity for reflection."}

The shares of this electric vehicle (EV) giant have declined by over 23% year-to-date, pressured by concerns over signs of softer demand for EVs. Furthermore, heightened competition in the EV market has compelled the company to consistently lower its average selling prices, negatively affecting its profit margins and share price.\n\nAdding to the challenges, Tesla’s management has offered a cautious outlook for 2024. The company anticipates a significant decrease in volumes compared to 2023, falling well below its targeted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50%. Although this expected slowdown in volume growth is driven by a strategic shift towards developing new products, such as its next-generation low-cost EV, it is perceived as a negative development.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, let's analyze various factors to gain insights into what the future holds for Tesla stock in 2024.\n\nThe Bull Case for Tesla Stock\n\nTesla is the world’s leading manufacturer of fully electric vehicles. In addition, it provides solar energy generation solutions and energy storage devices. Tesla achieved a remarkable milestone by manufacturing 1,845,985 consumer vehicles and delivering 1,808,581 units in 2023. Notably, the Model Y emerged as its best-selling vehicle worldwide in 2023, with over 1.2 million units delivered. This stellar performance solidifies Tesla’s dominant position in the EV market, showcasing its resilience in the face of intensified competition.\n\nLooking ahead, Tesla’s strategic initiatives to expand its manufacturing capabilities, along with the introduction of new vehicle models and next-generation platforms, position it well for growth. Furthermore, the company’s commitment to cost reduction, including the ability to source and manufacture components locally, provide a strategic advantage. This enables Tesla to offer competitive pricing, plus maintain and grow its market share.\n\nIt is important to note that Tesla strategically utilizes its industry-leading profit margins to aggressively lower prices and boost sales volumes. This approach poses considerable challenges for competitors, as they are compelled to reduce prices, even if it impacts their profitability. Tesla has consistently reduced its cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, and in Q4 2023, its COGS per vehicle came in slightly above $36,000, compared to nearly $40,000 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nTesla remains committed to expanding its production and identifying additional cost efficiencies throughout 2024. By prioritizing the reduction of the COGS per vehicle, Tesla aims to fortify its profit margins, which will drive further volume growth in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIn addition to reducing the cost per vehicle, Tesla is enhancing the performance and functionality of its cars to bolster demand. This involves advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven products like Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Autopilot, along with various software features. These strategic initiatives position Tesla advantageously to maintain and protect its market share.\n\nBeyond EVs, Tesla experienced significant growth in its energy storage deployments, which reached 14.7 GWh in 2023 — more than double the previous year’s figures. Further, its Energy Generation and Storage division's profit nearly quadrupled in 2023. Finally, the Services & Other business swung from a loss of approximately $500 million in 2019 to a profit of about $500 million in 2023.\n\nTo sum it up, Tesla is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing shift towards clean energy and electrification of the automotive sector.\n\nThe Bear Case for Tesla Stock\n\nTesla’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and its margins could start to show acceleration, benefiting from improving the mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin - including FSD, supercharging, and Megapacks.\n\nHowever, short-term challenges, such as heightened competition and lower prices, may continue to squeeze Tesla's margins. Notably, increased competition in China, mainly from BYD (BYDDY), could exert pressure on the company's profitability.\n\nFurthermore, as Tesla’s margin gap with competitors narrows, its premium valuation becomes harder to justify - potentially limiting upside potential in 2024.\n\nWhat's the Bottom Line for Tesla Investors?\n\nGiven the near-term margin headwinds and expected decline in delivery volumes, analysts are not too bullish about Tesla stock in the near term. The consensus recommendation is now “Hold,” down from “Moderate Buy” a month ago.\n\nAmong the 28 analysts covering Tesla stock, seven have “Strong Buy” ratings, two recommend “Moderate Buy,” 15 have a “Hold,” and four suggest “Strong Sell.” Moreover, the average price target is $223.96, which implies relatively limited upside potential of about 16.8% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sneha Nahata did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The issue is that “warning lights with a smaller font size can make critical safety information on the instrument panel difficult to read,” said the notice External link posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website.\n\nThe font has to be at least an eighth of an inch in height. The agency said Tesla’s font had been one sixteenth of an inch high. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt’s serious enough to change, but the recall didn’t come from customer complaints or accidents. On Jan. 8, NHTSA told Tesla its font was too small after conducting a compliance audit External link . That is just the system designed to keep cars safe.\n\nAs Barron’s has written many times, tens of millions of cars are recalled each year. Tesla’s recalls get more attention because it is the world’s most valuable auto maker, led by Elon Musk, one of the world’s richest people.\n\n(Musk’s title of world’s richest is in flux after a Delaware judge nullified his 2018 pay package, wiping out some $50 billion in wealth. The Tesla board, however, will likely have to remedy the situation with a new pay package.)\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nTesla recalls can often involve large numbers. That is because the company has the largest fleet of connected vehicles in the U.S. It fixes most minor issues—including font size—with over-the-air software updates.\n\nMore than 99% of all Tesla recalls are fixed with software updates. Barron’s finds that Tesla runs into hardware-based recalls about as often as any other auto maker.\n\nTesla investors also receive another potential shock from NHTSA. The agency has opened an investigation into the loss of power steering in model year 2023 Tesla Model 3 and Y vehicles. Investors should note that investigations precede recalls in the automotive safety world. Once NHTSA identifies an issue, often from questionnaires or complaints, they determine if there is an issue that needs fixing.\n\nNHTSA started looking at the power-steering issue in July 2023 after ”receiving 12 Vehicle Owner Questionnaires reporting [a] loss of steering control in model years.”\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nNHTSA has initiated 11 investigations so far in 2024 after starting 66 in 2023. This year’s investigations involve Tesla, Ford Motor, Kia, and Stellantis, among others. Issues range from power steering to fuel pump performance to vehicle braking.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up The Barron's Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers. Preview Subscribed\n\nInvestors should watch out for issue, but remember that NHTSA is always looking to improve vehicle safety.\n\nThe bigger issue for Tesla might be Ford’s January delivery results. Battery electric-vehicle sales were down that month about 54% from December, and down about 11% year over year. Ford delivered some 4,700 battery-electric vehicles in January.\n\nWeak sales will fuel concerns about slowing overall battery-electric vehicle sales growth. Americans bought about 1.2 million all-BEVs in 2023, a record, and up roughly 45% compared with 2022.\n\nFord stock is down 0.1%, while shares of EV makers Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group are off 2.4% and 5.7%, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nAnother issue for Tesla on Friday might be related to hazardous waste. Tesla has agreed to pay $1.5 million—a relatively small penalty for the company—to settle allegations over the company’s handling of hazardous materials including oil, lead acid batteries, antifreeze and diesel fuel at as many as 101 sites across California. MarketWatch reported External link the lawsuit had been filed by 25 California counties earlier this week.\n\nThis comes amid a difficult start to 2024 for Tesla. EV sales in China have been slow to start the year, conflict in the Middle East has hampered production at its German plant, and Tesla has continued to cut vehicle prices to spur demand.\n\nAll that has caused 2024 earnings estimates to fall. Wall Street now expects 2024 earnings per share of $3.12, according to FactSet; at the start of 2024, that number was $3.81.\n\nThat is the best reason to pin Tesla’s weak stock performance on—earnings matter far more than recalls. Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock was off about 24% year to date."}

Its electric vehicles readily receive applause or disdain, and its mercurial chief executive, Elon Musk, has more than his fair share of fans and foes.\n\nThe hit-or-miss nature of Tesla stock reflects the tug-of-war, given its one of the most volatile stocks in the S&P 500.\n\nFor instance, Tesla shares tumbled during the 2022 bear market. Then, they more than doubled from their lows to their 2023 highs. More recently, they've fallen out of favor again, dropping nearly 30% since mid-December.\n\nThe sell-off likely surprised many, given hopes for ever-growing electric vehicle sales, new factories, and the launch of the much-hyped Cybertruck.\n\nHowever, Real Money Pro analyst Bruce Kamich wasn't shocked. He correctly predicted in early January that Tesla stock would fall, writing that his analysis concluded that Tesla shares had \"more risk than upside opportunity.\"\n\nKamich recently updated his analysis, and given his track record, investors may want to pay attention.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has seen Tesla's shares trade incredibly volatilely over the past two years. Shutterstock\n\nTesla is the EV sales leader, but growth slowed in 2023\n\nTesla reimagined the electric vehicle market. Rather than designing vehicles for environmentalists, Elon Musk concentrated the car company's efforts on building high-performance luxury cars.\n\nThe strategy worked. Its Model S Plaid outperformed top brands like Porsche, making it a fan of enthusiasts. It has since launched the highly popular Model Y, a crossover SUV, and the Model 3, a lower-cost sedan with high-performance roots.\n\nThe Model Y and the Model 3 are both offered in configurations that deliver eye-popping speed, with each able to go from zero to sixty miles per hour in under four seconds.\n\nMusk's focus on performance rather than economy has upturned the auto industry, arguably single-handedly setting EVs on a course to win away a significant share of auto sales from traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.\n\nTesla has clearly profited from this approach. Its fourth-quarter revenue was $25 billion, and Wall Street analysts expect it will deliver $3.12 profit per share in 2024.\n\nThat's impressive, but Tesla has recently become a victim of its success. The widespread interest in EVs has led major rivals, including Mercedes, Ford, and GM, to launch their own EV alternatives, and those vehicles are biting into Tesla's market share.\n\nAccording to Cox Automotive, total U.S. EV sales surged by 40% in Q4 to 317,168. Tesla accounted for half of all EVs sold in the quarter. However, that's down from 62% in Q1 2023.\n\nThe loss in market share has happened despite Elon Musk cutting prices to spark sales. The combination of lower market share and lower prices has taken a stiff toll on the company's financial performance, leading to anemic 3% year-over-year revenue growth and a 40% decline in profit during the fourth quarter.\n\nGiven that backdrop, it's unsurprising that Tesla's shares have taken a nosedive this year.\n\nTesla's price charts result in a new price target\n\nKamich has used price and volume charts to analyze stocks or markets professionally for over 50 years. His technical analysis accurately forecasted that Tesla stock would reach $300 before declining to $193. Then, after a rally, it allowed him to accurately warn of the risk of downside in January.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nKamich reconsidered Tesla's daily and weekly charts on Feb. 1 for insight into what could be next for Tesla's stock. He also used a daily point-and-figure chart to calculate a new price target. Unfortunately (if you're a Tesla fan), Kamich thinks Tesla shares could still fall further.\n\n\"I can see an evolving bearish picture. The shares have weakened so far in 2024. Prices gapped lower in the middle of January and have not shown us signs of a bottom reversal. The popular moving averages have weakened, and now we can see a bearish dead or death cross-sell signal, with the 50-day line falling below the slower-to-react 200-day line,\" writes Kamich. \"The trading volume has been neutral, and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is still pointed down. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is in a bearish alignment below the zero line.\"\n\nOn-balance volume is essentially a running total of up minus down volume, while MACD measures momentum.\n\nSince up-day volume is poor relative to down-day volume and the MACD is negative, Kamich is cautious.\n\nIt doesn't help that Kamich's analysis of point-and-figure charts is also worrisome. Using a daily P&F chart, he calculates a Tesla stock price target of $150.\n\n\"Tesla is looking poised for further declines,\" concludes Kamich. \"Avoid the long side of [Tesla] TSLA.\""}

The Journal also wrote a story detailing alleged drug use by Musk in January External link .\n\nTesla didn’t respond to a request for comment about the weekend report.

The reporting on Musk is a small factor in the stock drop. Investors are mainly worried about weaker-than-expected growth for Tesla. The company shipped 1.8 million electric vehicles in 2023, up almost 40% from 2022. In the company’s fourth-quarter earnings report, Tesla said External link , “In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.”\n\nWall Street is modeling 2.1 million units sold in 2024, up about 17%. A few months ago that projection was for almost 2.4 million units.\n\nLoading tweet...\n\nAll of the Musk-related news is just one more thing for investors to worry about. The “building narrative [is] ultimately noise for the stock,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. He doesn’t sound too concerned about governance at Tesla.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\n“The Street knows Musk is not home Saturday night reading a novel drinking milk and eating cookies. If the U.S. Government is fine and backs Musk so will Tesla shareholders.”\n\nIves is referring to the government’s contracts with Musk’s space company SpaceX. Musk pointed out in a recent tweet that he is subject to random drug testing as a government contractor.\n\n“The risk really is his job at SpaceX with this type of report,” said Baird analyst Ben Kallo, adding that attacks on Tesla’s governance, of course, will raise some concern for Tesla shareholders.\n\nKallo rates Tesla stock a Buy and he has a $300 price target on the shares. Ives rates Tesla stock at Buy with a $315 price target. About 41% of analysts who cover Tesla stock have Buy ratings, and an average price target is about $216, according to FactSet. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up The Barron's Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers. Preview Subscribed\n\nEven if Ives is correct, there is a lot of Musk-related “noise” for investors to digest. The weekend report of drug use with directors comes days after a Delaware court voided Musk’s 2018 pay package, which awarded him options for some 300 million Tesla shares that vested based on hitting performance milestones. Musk, in response to the ruling, said he is considering moving the legal incorporation of Tesla from Delaware to Texas.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nLooking ahead, the Tesla board will have to redo the 2018 pay package—or draft an entirely new compensation plan. That will keep Musk’s worth, and importance to Tesla, top of mind for investors.\n\nOther EV stocks, along with Tesla are down in Monday trading. Shares of Lucid Group were down 4.7%, NIO stock dropped 3%, and shares of Chinese EV giant BYD were down 0.9%. General Motors shares fell 2.7%.\n\nMusk’s EV leadership could impact the entire industry, but other EV stocks likely were down because of earnings reported from ON Semiconductor.\n\nON supplies chips to the auto industry, and in general EVs use more chips than traditional cars. The company’s October earnings report set off a slew of selling in the EV space after it guided fourth-quarter sales to about $2 billion when Wall Street was looking for $2.2 billion.\n\nFourth-quarter sales reported Monday were in line with guidance. Looking ahead, the company guided first-quarter revenue to about $1.85 billion. Wall Street was looking for $1.92 billion. It looks as if sales at ON will be down year over year for the fourth consecutive quarter.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nFalling sales mean less ordering from the auto makers, which means the auto makers don’t see robust demand early in the year. It’s another sign of weaker-than-hoped-for demand for the EV space to start 2024.\n\nON stock, however, was up 8.1% on Monday.

That makes Tesla the worst-performing stock listed on the benchmark S&P 500 index. Tesla’s 2024 decline began with a post-earnings plunge after the company missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and revenue, but the latest selloff coincides with increased controversy surrounding Musk, who has clamored for significantly higher power within Tesla and taken to his X social media platform to spew fringe-right claims. Heightened concerns about Tesla’s board’s ability to govern Musk peaked with a Saturday report in the Wall Street Journal alleging Musk and Tesla board members have taken illegal drugs together (Musk previously claimed his drug tests contained “not even trace quantities” of drugs or alcohol).\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser website GO TO PAGE PLAY Forbes Business\n\nCrucial Quote\n\nThe allegations outlined in the Journal pose the latest “black cloud” on Tesla, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Forbes, partially attributing Monday’s stock dip to the salacious report.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nShares of Tesla have fallen more this year than the likes of Boeing, whose shares are down 21% in 2024 amid controversy about the safety of its commercial airplanes, and agricultural giant Archers-Daniels-Midland, whose shares are down 21% as it grapples with a probe into alleged accounting fraud.\n\nKey Background\n\nFor better and worse, Tesla stock has long been subject to the whims of the mercurial Musk, perhaps most famously proven during Tesla’s 65% selloff in 2022 as Musk offloaded a massive chunk of his Tesla holdings to fund his purchase of the social media platform now known as X. Tesla’s fortunes in 2024 are far worse than those of the other members of the “magnificent seven” tech stocks whose valuations ballooned last year. Apple is the only other member of the group whose shares are down year-to-date, at a far milder 2%, and Apple and Tesla are the only ones of the group not to report double-digit sales growth last quarter. Tesla’s profits declined 23% from 2022 to 2023, and analysts project negative bottom line growth again this year, according to FactSet.\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nMusk is the world’s second-richest person with a net worth of $195 billion, according to our real-time estimates. Musk is about $55 billion poorer than he was at the end of 2023 thanks to Tesla stock’s drop and a Delaware judge’s axing of a $51 billion Tesla stock-based compensation for Musk last week."}

Tesla hasn’t responded to requests for comment about the stories, although the Journal cited comments from a lawyer for Musk saying the Tesla CEO has repeatedly been tested for drugs in connection with his work at SpaceX, which is a government contractor.\n\nThat isn’t all that is weighing on shares though. Falling prices and slowing EV sales growth have also been concerns of investors. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Tesla was considering layoffs, another sign of industry weakness. Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. Tesla employs some 140,000 people around the globe.\n\nWeakening EV demand and falling prices have also weighed on Ford Motor shares. Coming into Wednesday trading, shares were down about 1% year to date.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nFord, however, reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and forecast a range of potential 2024 operating profits with a midpoint of about $11 billion. That was about $1 billion more than Wall Street projected and up from the $10.4 billion generated in 2023. It was a relief to investors and showed that the outlook for the auto industry isn’t as dire as some investors feared.\n\nFord stock was up almost 6% in late trading to just $12.76 a share.\n\nTesla stock remains well off its 52-week high of $299.29, which the company reached last summer. The stock was rising with most of its competitors Wednesday as Lucid rose 0.9% to $3.53 in the premarket, NIO fell 2.3% to $5.89, and BYD was up 1% in Hong Kong trading. General Motors rose 1.3% to $38.54.\n\nTesla’s trading volume of 122.7 million shares at Tuesday’s close was 5.3 million below its 65-day average volume of 117.4 million.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nWrite to Rupert Steiner at rupert.steiner@barrons.com External link\n\n\n\n"}

That would be a 1% decline vs. last year's $3.12. That was a 23% decline vs. 2022. Analyst project a solid increase in 2025 to $4.24 a share. However, Wall Street has slashed projections from $5.27 at the end of last year and $6.90 at the end of February 2023. Meanwhile, actual Tesla earnings peaked in 2022 at $4.07 a share.\n\nOn Feb. 7, Gary Black, the managing partner of the Future Fund, posted on X that with Tesla slipping to ninth in market capitalization, \"investors increasingly view TSLA as no longer part of the Magnificent 7.\"\n\n\"I find this sad, since TSLA being part of the Mag 7 was viewed as being at the top of the innovation food chain, the most glamorous of the growth stocks, America's finest,\" Black wrote.\n\nSo far in 2024, Tesla stock has retreated nearly 26%, falling below key levels of support, as the EV giant appears headed for a difficult year after CEO Elon Musk offered a tempered outlook with few specifics on Jan. 24.\n\nHowever, as analysts await news on auto gross profit margins, excluding regulatory credits, and whether vehicle pricing will stabilize, the top question for investors is always, when is it a good time to buy or sell Tesla stock.\n\nTesla Stock: Q4 Earnings\n\nWall Street slashed 2024 profit projections after Tesla reported worse-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and revenue in late January, with longtime Tesla bull Dan Ives summing up the conference call as a \"train wreck.\"\n\nTesla reported that Q4 earnings fell 40% to 71 cents per share. Meanwhile, quarterly revenue totaled $25.17 billion, up 3.5% vs. Q4 2022. Tesla's gross profit margin came in at 17.6%, down 612 basis points. For 2023, Tesla EPS fell 23% to $3.12 while revenue increased 19% to $96.77 billion.\n\nIn 2024, Tesla's \"vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023 \"as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas,\" according to the company.\n\nTesla said it is also \"currently between two major growth waves,\" with the \"global expansion\" of the Model 3 and Model Y vehicle platform \"and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform.\"\n\n\"There's lots to look forward to in 2024,\" Musk said on the earnings call. He added that Tesla is focused on ensuring that its next-generation vehicle, energy storage, full self driving and \"other projects\" are \"executed as well as possible.\"\n\nHowever, without any specifics and no word on its vehicle price cutting strategy or what way profit margins are expected to go in 2024, Wall Street has cut profit expectations. Many Tesla bulls have also turned bearish on the short-term outlook for TSLA.\n\nTesla Stock No Longer A 'Best Idea'\n\nWedbush Securities removed Tesla stock from its list of \"best ideas\" for 2024 following earnings as Ives outlined a number of items Tesla and CEO Elon Musk must address for TSLA to recover.\n\nWedbush analyst Ives said that TSLA will remain off the firm's list of best ideas until there is evidence that Musk and the company takes up their suggestions.\n\nIves wrote a list of 10 items for \"Musk to turn Tesla around.\" The firm's asks include Tesla to announce a $10 billion share buyback program, to create a holding structure for AI initiatives and give Musk more control, stop vehicle price cuts to maintain margin leverage over other automakers, get assurance Musk will not do more TSLA stock sales to fund X, and to give a \"hittable\" production and delivery timeline for Model 2 and sub $30k vehicle in 2025.\n\nIves, who has been one of the most bullish supporters of Tesla, cut his Tesla price target to 315, down from 350.\n\nAnalysts Voice Tesla Concerns\n\n\"We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure and fluctuating demand,\" Ives wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, another Tesla bull, wrote that the 2024 outlook was the \"least detailed we remember.\" He added that Tesla profitability could drop toward the $2 per share level.\n\n\"Investors and analysts are very much 'on their own' when it comes to the FY2024 revenue and growth outlook,\" Jonas wrote.\n\nBernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi noted in late January that 2024 will be a challenging year for Tesla and that it is becoming \"increasingly apparent that 2025 will likely not be better.\"\n\nQ4 Earnings Overshadow Record Deliveries\n\nThe company delivered 461,538 Model 3/Y vehicles in Q4 and 22,969 \"other models.\" Tesla currently produces the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, Model X and Cybertruck.\n\nTesla's previous quarterly delivery record was in Q2 with 466,140. In Q3, TSLA delivered 435,059 units.\n\nTesla had been aiming to deliver 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. Ahead of Tesla's data release, Wall Street consensus had Tesla vehicle deliveries in 2023 totaling 1.797 million, just below that 1.8 million target, according to FactSet.\n\nCybertruck Event\n\nThe pessimism at the end of 2023 followed the excitement surrounding the Nov. 30 Cybertruck event.\n\nTesla delivered 12 Cybertrucks at its Austin, Texas, factory with pomp and circumstance.\n\n\"We have a car here that experts said was impossible, that experts said would never be made,\" Chief Executive Elon Musk told the crowd.\n\nThe EV giant is offering three trims of the Cybertruck, with the rear-wheel drive version starting at $60,990 with a 250 mile range. The base model will be available in 2025, according to Tesla's website.\n\nThe all-wheel drive version has a starting price of $79,990 with 340 miles of range. Tesla is also offering a top end trim, called the Cyberbeast, starting at $99,990 with a 320 mile range. Both the all-wheel drive version and the Cyberbeast have 2024 deliveries.\n\nFour years ago, Tesla announced the price would start at $39,900.\n\nTesla Stock Falls Amid Growth Concerns\n\nTSLA shares sank after the company announced worse-than-expected Q3 earnings and revenue on October 18, 2023. Tesla reported third-quarter earnings down 37% to 66 cents per share, the lowest in two years for Chief Executive Elon Musk.\n\nMeanwhile, quarterly revenue increased 9% to $23.35 billion. Tesla's auto gross profit margins, excluding regulatory credits, fell to 16.3%. Auto gross margins came in at 18.1% in Q2, down from 19% in Q1. That is below the 20% gross margin \"floor\" Tesla previously targeted.\n\nElon Musk on the earnings call also preached caution, offering investors warnings about the Cybertruck and the broader economy. The following day, Tesla stock fell 9.3%.\n\nMusk said it will take 12-18 months before the Cybertruck is a \"significant positive cash flow contributor.\" He added there will be \"enormous challenges\" in reaching volume production.\n\nMusk has said Tesla will end up producing around 250,000 Cybertruck units per year, reaching that output sometime in 2025.\n\nTesla Stock And Musk\n\nThere is never a dull moment for Tesla and Musk, with the two inextricably linked. After Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 28, 2022 purchasing the social media platform for $44 billion, some longtime Tesla stock bulls worried Musk's focus on Twitter, along with negative attention, would weigh down Tesla stock.\n\nMusk appeared to lessen those fears when he hired Linda Yaccarino, NBCUniversal's advertising chief, as the new CEO for X Corp., formerly known as Twitter. The Tesla chief added Yaccarino will focus on business operations while he will work on product design and new technology.\n\nAt the time, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote the news ends some of the \"distraction risk around the Tesla story.\"\n\nHowever, Tesla stock cut back below a key technical level early on Nov. 16, following a four-day, almost 18% rally. The pullback also came after comments made on X by Chief Executive Elon Musk in support of an antisemitic post.\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk on Jan. 15 posted on X that he feels he needs more TSLA shares and voting power before making the EV giant an AI and robotics leader.\n\nMusk wrote that he's \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.\" The chief executive added that he wants enough shares to be \"influential but not so much that I can't be overturned.\"\n\nOn Feb. 3, the Wall Street Journal reported that some Tesla board members felt pressure to do drugs with Elon Musk. The in-depth report said some friends have urged him to go to rehab, and highlighted concerns that the board is not sufficiently independent from Musk.\n\nTesla's Global Price Cutting Strategy\n\nTo maintain sales momentum in 2023, Tesla aggressively cut vehicle prices and offered discounts throughout the year. Auto gross margins, which peaked at 30% in Q4 2021 amid industry chip shortages, have plunged well below 20%.\n\nTesla has continued cutting prices early in 2024, deciding in January to trim China vehicle prices on the Model 3 and two Model Y variants and slashing Model Y prices in many European countries.\n\nOn Feb. 4, the EV giant raised the U.S. price of its Model 3 Long Range variant. The Model 3 LR price is now $46,990, an increase of $1,000. Tesla kept the U.S. price of its Rear-Wheel Drive version at $38,990.\n\nThe price hike may reflect strong demand for the upgraded \"Highland\" Model 3 or simply limited supply. Model 3 production is down significantly in the first quarter as the Fremont plant switched over to the Highland model.\n\nTesla Vehicle Price Inversion\n\nTesla's latest move further inverts prices between the Model 3 and Model Y, with the latter traditionally more expensive.\n\nThe Model Y RWD is $43,990, with the Long Range variant $48,990 and the Performance variant is $52,490. But the Model Y is eligible for the IRA tax credit of $7,500, so customers actually pay $36,490, $41,490 or $44,990 for the Model Y.\n\nTesla on Feb. 4 also allowed a free transfer of Full Self-Driving (FSD) in North America for FSD owners who take delivery of new eligible EVs by March 31.\n\nOn Jan 17, Gary Black posted on X that based on the January price cuts he was revising 2024 earnings estimates to $3.75 per share, down from $3.90 per share.\n\nBlack added that Tesla management \"still does not see that cutting configurator prices and inventory discounts by the same amount is value destructive.\"\n\nHertz Signals Waning EV Demand?\n\nOn Jan. 11, Tesla stock traded below its 200-day moving average for the first since late November as Hertz (HTZ) announced it is selling about one-third of its EV fleet and that it predicts $245 million of incremental depreciation expenses related to the sale in the fourth quarter.\n\nHertz reported it will sell around 20,000 electric vehicles and that it expects to reinvest a portion of the proceeds from the sales into the purchase of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to meet customer demand. In 2021, Hertz ordered 100,000 Tesla vehicles, with the goal to convert around 20% of its global fleet to EVs.\n\nTesla Momentum, Competition In China\n\nTesla ended 2023 on a high in China. However, the EV dynamic in China could quickly change. Musk has said China's EV companies are Tesla's main competition — with BYD (BYDDF), Nio (NIO), Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO) and others all making inroads in the EV market.\n\nBYD, already far above Tesla EV sales including plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), overtook its U.S. rival in global BEV deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023. Warren Buffett-backed BYD has also decided to open a plant in Europe, moving onto Tesla's turf on another continent. BYD already is building plants in Thailand and Brazil.\n\nTesla is reportedly planning to revamp the Model Y in China with mass production beginning as early as mid-2024, according to Bloomberg. This comes after it launched a new Model 3 with a modest refresh.\n\nBut will that be enough? Chinese EV makers keep cutting prices and stepping up vehicle quality and specs.\n\nTesla EVs In Regulators' Sights\n\nEntering 2024, Tesla faces mounting pressure from regulators. A recent Reuters investigation found the EV giant has known of faulty suspension and steering parts across its model lineup going back at least seven years, but often blamed drivers when those parts failed.\n\nNorway's traffic safety regulator recently confirmed that it's been investigating suspension failures in Model S and X vehicles since September 2022. A resolution is expected soon, with a recall possible.\n\nSweden announced on December 22, 2023 that it's also looking into similar issues. The Reuters report could bolster regulators' probes and provide fodder for class-action lawsuits.\n\nThis comes after a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation recently spurred Tesla to perform an over-the-air software \"recall\" on more than 2 million vehicles after determining that the Autopilot is prone to misuse after reviewing 1,000 accidents.\n\nThe NHTSA's Autopilot safety probe is ongoing.\n\nNext-Generation Electric Vehicle On The Way?\n\nMeanwhile, Musk and Tesla appear to be focusing on the $25,000 next-generation electric vehicle.\n\nReuters reported ahead of Q4 earnings that Tesla has told suppliers it wants to begin production of a new mass market vehicle, code-named \"Redwood,\" in mid-2025.\n\n\"We're very far along on our next generation low cost vehicle,\" Musk said on the Q4 earnings call.\n\nMusk added Wednesday that Tesla is currently looking to start production sometime in the second half of 2025. However, Musk cautioned his words should be \"taken with a grain of salt.\"\n\nThroughout 2023, Tesla said it continued to \"make progress\" on its next-generation platform. The EV company has remained mostly silent on details about the vehicle. At the annual shareholder meeting last spring, Tesla teased a vehicle silhouette.\n\nMusk confirmed on Jan. 24 that the first production line for the next-generation Tesla vehicle will be at its Texas facility. Tesla originally said the new vehicle would first be produced in Mexico, but that proposed plant is on the back burner.\n\nHowever, it's unclear when the next-generation vehicle would begin deliveries. Musk has promised \"revolutionary\" manufacturing to cut costs, but that could take a long time to develop.\n\nAlso, it's unclear if Tesla's next-gen EV will be eligible for tax credits, depending on its battery sourcing. The Model 3 is no longer eligible for IRA credits of $7,500.\n\nIs Tesla Stock A Buy?\n\nTesla stock has retreated more than 25% in 2024. TSLA shares have tumbled below the 50-day and 200-day lines after booking six weekly declines between late December and early February. Shares rose 2.5% to 187.91 last week, snapping its string of consecutive weekly losses.\n\nOn Feb. 5, Tesla stock sank 3.7% to 181.02, hitting a fresh eight-month low of 175.01 intraday. It's the S&P 500's worst performer so far in 2024. Tesla has a forward price-to-earnings ratio at a lofty 58.\n\nThe relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, is at a lowly 20, according to MarketSmith.\n\nIn 2023 Tesla doubled, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500 index. Tesla stock ranks ninth in the 35 member IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group. The stock has a 42 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. Tesla stock also has a 21 Relative Strength Rating and a 69 EPS Rating.\n\nAlmost single-handedly, Elon Musk has turned the auto industry on its head. He has essentially forced it to get aboard the electric-vehicle train. It's a reason why Tesla has been a monster stock over much of its history, especially during its stratospheric run from mid-2019 to late 2021.\n\nTesla stock has had mammoth runs and could again.

The recent trading action, however, isn’t exactly what shareholders should want.\n\nTesla stock closedup 2.1% at $193.57, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 0.6% and 1.3%, respectively. Lucid Group was up 0.3%, NIO shares gained 1.8%. BYD stock lost 0.7% in Hong Kong trading. General Motors dropped 0.2%.\n\nPart of the reason could be that New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu wrote Friday that he sees Tesla shipping 8.4 million vehicles in 2030. That implies average annual growth of about 25% for the coming seven years.\n\nA lower-priced Tesla is key to his estimate. Ferragu expects that car to be launchedin 2025 and to sell roughly 5 million units a year by the end of the decade. He is a Tesla bull, rating shares Buy. His price target is $270 a share.\n\nTesla stock closed Thursday at $189.65, with a gain of 1.1%, following data from China that showed Tesla’s retail car sales fell month over month in January. Tesla sold 71,447 vehicles made in the Shanghai plant last month, up about 8% year over year, according to Citi analyst Jeff Chung who tracks data from the China Passenger Car Association.\n\nTesla shipped 94,139 units from its Shanghai plant in December, a seasonally strong month for car shipments.\n\nTesla stock was still down 22% for the year at Friday’s close, but the shares are no longer oversold.

Coming into this week, Tesla stock looked severely oversold after dropping 12% in the days following its fourth-quarter numbers.\n\nNow the trading pattern looks more normal. Tesla stock stopped being oversold on Wednesday, which isn’t necessarily great for traders or shareholders. It can mean no big bounce is coming.\n\nShareholders would prefer a rebound after the tough start to the year. Tesla stock has underperformed the Nasdaq by some 29 percentage points year to date.\n\nClosing that gap, however, will take improving profit margins. Price cuts have hurt Tesla’s margins. Fourth-quarter operating profit margin came in at about 8%, down from 16% a year earlier.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue"}

Or does it?\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThat’s part of a growing debate on Wall Street, where shares of Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle maker are tanking as the rest of the market rallies — and the company is warning that things may not get better for a while. An original member of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 Index to new heights, traders are now wondering if Tesla’s name belongs next to those other powerhouses.\n\nAfter doubling last year, Tesla’s stock price is down 22% to start 2024. Compare that to Nvidia Corp.’s 46% surge or Meta Platforms Inc.’s 32% gain since the beginning of the year and it’s easy to see where the questions are coming from. Indeed, it’s by far the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven Index this year.\n\nThe problem for the EV maker is six of those seven companies are benefiting from the enthusiasm surrounding burgeoning artificial intelligence technology. The group hit a record 29.5% weighting in the S&P 500 last week even with Tesla’s decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But despite Musk’s efforts to position his company as an AI investment, the reality is Tesla faces a unique set of challenges.\n\n“Although Elon Musk would probably disagree, investors don’t see Tesla as an AI play like most of the other Magnificent Seven stocks,” said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “We have a much different backdrop for Tesla and the others in the Mag Seven — the demand trend for Tesla products is fading, while it’s exploding higher for those companies that are more associated with AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nDimming Outlook\n\nAt the heart of this divide is the dimming outlook for electric vehicles. Demand is expected to slow in 2024, and perhaps beyond, raising doubts about Tesla’s ability to grow at the rapid pace investors are accustomed to seeing.\n\nRoughly a third of the analysts covering Tesla recommend buying the stock, compared to an average of 85% for the rest of the Magnificent Seven. Moreover, analysts have cut their average 2024 profit estimate for Tesla nearly in half over the past 12 months, while earnings expectations for the others have risen or stayed flat.\n\n“The challenge is that Tesla has become a one-product company — the Model Y, with every other initiative either not a meaningful contributor to revenue and earnings or still a bit of a science project,” said Jeffrey Osborne of Cowen. “Being a one-product company and mismanaging the timing of product cycles can create periods of pain, which is what we are in now until the next generation vehicle comes out next year or in 2026.”\n\nThe double trouble of slowing EV demand and shaky AI credentials make it hard for investors to swallow Tesla’s sky high valuation. Even with this year’s selloff, the stock trades at over 60 times forward earnings. The second-most expensive Magnificent Seven stock is Nvidia Corp. at around 36 times forward earnings, while the rest trade between the low twenties and low thirties.\n\n“During the year, others in the Mag Seven were able to show how AI was driving real, profitable business growth,” Brian Johnson, former auto analyst with Barclays and founder of Metonic Advisors, said in an interview. “Tesla investors just got some random Optimus videos, Musk’s admission Dojo was a moon shot and yet another full-self-driving release that may be an improvement but still a long ways from robotaxi capability.”\n\nIn contrast, the rest of the mega-cap technology companies boast of diverse and stable revenue streams, which in most cases translate into slightly slower growth, but also less volatile shares.\n\nFuture Bet\n\nTesla believers say the company’s unique position as the only profitable, large-scale, pure-play EV maker earns it a seat in the elite club. Even though demand is expected to fall in the near-term, experts widely expect electric cars to eventually come dominate the auto industry. For anyone willing to bet on that future, Tesla is still the only real game in town, which also explains its lofty market valuation and the all-or-nothing nature of the company’s stock price — soaring 50% in 2021, plunging 65% in 2022, and then leaping 102% in 2023.\n\n“I can understand traders being short-term negative on the stock,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “But long-term investors are likely more positive given that no other EV maker can profitably produce the volume of units that Tesla does, in the pure EV space.”\n\nBullish Tesla investors also point out that the company’s revenue growth beyond 2024 is expected to surpass all of the Magnificent Seven other than Nvidia Corp. Its earnings are also projected to bounce back in 2025 after dropping this year, and will be climbing at a faster pace than most other mega-caps.\n\nStill, Tesla’s heavy exposure to the cyclical automotive industry makes it stand out among the Magnificent Seven, particularly in light of the uncertainty around the technology of self-driving cars. Though Musk has often claimed that a future where the so-called robotaxis will be a common thing is not far off, most industry experts believe it’s still years, if not decades, away.\n\n“Tesla is one of the riskier companies we cover because the underlying business is cyclical and the autonomy piece is binary,” said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer of Spear Invest. “They will either crack the code on autonomy or this will drag for many years before anyone has a solution.”\n\n--With assistance from Jeran Wittenstein.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."}

China's BYD Auto Co., Ltd. (BYDDF) continues to make inroads into Tesla’s market share for lower-priced EV vehicles, recently overtaking the U.S. carmaker to become the world’s top electric vehicle manufacturer by the end of 2023.3 The latest price cuts will continue to pressure Tesla’s operating margin, which contracted to 8.2% in the December quarter as the company focuses on deliveries to boost sales.4\n\nTesla shares have oscillated within a descending channel over the past seven months, apart from a bull trap breakout in mid-December. More recently, buyers have defended the pattern’s lower trendline around $175, although trading volume has remained slightly below average. Looking ahead, it’s worth keeping an eye how the price responds to the channel’s upper and lower boundaries for clues on the stock’s next move. Bear in mind that the channel’s top trendline also roughly aligns with the 50- and 200-day moving averages that may provide additional resistance around the $225 to $233 region on the chart.\n\nTesla shares finished Friday's session at $193.57.

An argument can be made that the the shares, which have fallen almost 20% over the past month, have already reached that point.\n\nSince the electric vehicle maker reported its fourth quarter earnings January 24, TSLA stock has given up as much as 17%, falling to a low of $175. While the stock has recovered since then, reaching a recent high of $194, there’s still a 37% gap from its 52-week high of $299. This includes 20% declines in six months, while the S&P 500 index is up 12.5%. As it stands, the stock is now down 22% year to date, trailing the 5.4% rise in the S&P 500 index.\n\nFor investors who are waiting for the dust to settle, there are still plenty of reasons to expect Tesla stock to march higher. The stock has gotten grossly oversold as a result of Tesla missing Q4 estimates on both earnings and revenue. While Wall Street continues to focus on the company’s pricing challenges and headwinds related to demand, this isn’t the first time that pundits have proclaimed the death of the EV transformation and called into question Tesla’s leadership capabilities in that industry.\n\nARK Invest's Cathie Wood remains bullish on the Tesla stock. \"Tesla is going through a low right now related to the cycle,\" Wood said on CNBC. \"But when autonomous taxi networks, platforms kick in, as we think they will within the next two years... then what we’re talking about with Tesla is a reacceleration in growth and a huge increase in margins,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, who believes the bears have it wrong, added more assurance to Tesla stock. \"We could not disagree more with the ultra negative Tesla narrative building and forming a black cloud over the stock,\" Ives wrote in a note to investors. \"While the next few months are clearly a bit cloudy for the Tesla story and overall EV demand, longer term our view is that by the end of the decade ~20% of autos will be EV with autonomous and FSD a reality and not a dream/aspiration.\"\n\nIn citing Tesla’s downbeat earnings report, Ives was unwavering in his support, maintaining his buy-equivalent “Outperform” rating with a 12-month price target of $315. From current levels, Ives price target assumes potential premiums of 66%. To be sure, there are still critical questions that Tesla must answer for investors, namely the outlook for margins after price cuts in several markets. This is where the company will need to show revenue growth in higher-margin service businesses such as its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which is poised to reenergize the company’s profit margins.\n\nThe company is betting heavily on FSD which will be the birth of the autonomous vehicle evolution and is designed to automate Tesla vehicles so they can operate without a driver behind the wheel. Tesla’s FSD is at Level 3 automation (conditional driving automation), which means a driver should be engaged at all time. However, once FSD can navigate autonomously, it will not only boost Tesla’s profit margins, it will be a profit center of recurring revenues for Tesla through the company’s ambition for Robotaxis.\n\nEssentially, while the market is focused on the near-term headwinds revealed in the Q4 earnings report, it was noteworthy that Tesla management spent a significant amount of time discussing high-margin services. The company’s efforts to monetize its FSD feature by licensing the FSD software to other EV makers can become a lucrative business to reenergize the stock. Essentially, Tesla’s current competitors may eventually become the company’s partners.\n\nAs such, with Tesla stock trading below where it stood both one year ago and two years ago, now is the time to bet on a rebound in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."}

Antonio Masiello | Getty Images\n\nTwo weeks after a Delaware court ruled that Tesla must rescind Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package, the company’s board remains mum on what the decision means for shareholders or what’s next for the mercurial CEO. In her 200-page opinion on Jan. 30, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick called the pay plan the largest in public corporate history, and said it was agreed upon by people “who were beholden to Musk.” Since then, Musk has lashed out at the court, posted “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware” on his social media platform X, and said Tesla would hold a shareholder vote to move its site of incorporation to Texas. Tesla hasn’t yet issued an SEC filing to notify shareholders of the ruling. The decision came shortly after Musk indicated that he’s pushing for even more control of Tesla, posting on X in mid-January that he wanted roughly 25% voting control before turning the company into a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics. Musk is already building an AI company called xAI outside of Tesla. The next step in the compensation case is an “implementing order” that will be hashed out between the court, Musk’s team and the lawyers representing shareholder Richard Tornetta, a former heavy metal drummer who was the plaintiff in the 2018 lawsuit filed on behalf of all Tesla investors. As shareholders await answers, Tesla’s eight-person board, which includes Musk, his brother Kimbal, Chairwoman Robyn Denholm and former Tesla technology chief JB Straubel, has stayed silent, avoiding any public comments. CNBC sent requests for additional information to Tesla investor relations, Musk and some board members. They all went unanswered.\n\nwatch now\n\nGreg Varallo, who was lead counsel for Tornetta and is head of the Delaware office of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, told CNBC that theoretically Musk and his legal team could still pursue a last-minute settlement. While Varallo said he has no knowledge of Musk’s plans, he said he expects Musk to appeal the decision to the Delaware state Supreme Court. “I’d give you very high odds on that,” Varallo said. Kobi Kastiel, a law professor at Tel Aviv University, also predicts that Musk will appeal the ruling. Kastiel wasn’t involved in the litigation but he co-authored a 2023 paper with colleague Assaf Hamdani in the Washington University Law Review titled “Superstar CEOs and Corporate Law” that was cited in McCormick’s ruling. “Given the high stakes involved, it is likely that Tesla will appeal the decision,” Kastiel said in an email. In the absence of a successful appeal, “any new compensation arrangement with him will have to be assessed” in light of McCormick’s decision, Kastiel said.\n\n‘Bunch of options would be returned’\n\nIn the 2018 CEO compensation plan, Tesla’s board awarded Musk a dozen tranches of stock options that would finish vesting in 2022 and were based on milestones, including many focused on stock price increases. Between the beginning of 2018 and the end of 2022, Tesla shares soared almost 500% as Musk promised to turn Tesla into not just a dominant EV brand, but a robotaxi company and solar juggernaut, among other things. The S&P 500 gained 44% over that stretch, while the Nasdaq rose 52%. Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School, told CNBC that, should the ruling stand, Musk will lose his options but not any shares he previously held. The move would decrease the number of shares outstanding, potentially bolstering the value of each share held by investors. “A bunch of options would be returned to Tesla’s coffers, which is hugely accretive to stock value,” said Talley, who wasn’t involved in the case. On the other hand, Talley pointed out, “Tesla has a very grumpy CEO who might want to take his ball and go home. Thus far, trading suggests those two factors have been a wash.” Tesla shares are down slightly since the Delaware court’s decision in late January. They’re down close to 25% for the year, while major indexes are up. Musk voiced a strong preference for moving his businesses out of Delaware following the court’s decision, and encouraged others to do so as well. He moved the incorporation location for his brain computer interface company, Neuralink, from Delaware to Nevada, filings revealed last week. He’s also been a big proponent of Texas in recent years, personally relocating there from California, and building massive complexes for SpaceX and Tesla in the state, which has no personal income taxes and a much lower business tax rate. Author Walter Isaacson, who published a 688-page biography on Musk last year, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday that if the ruling doesn’t get overturned, “it’s going to hurt Delaware.” “People will say, ‘Wait, wait, you mean five years after something happens, eight years after something happens, you’ll go back and undo it?’” Isaacson said. Tulane Law School professor Ann Lipton had a different take.\n\nwatch now\n\n“It’s a very thorough opinion and the Supreme Court should give great deference to the factual findings of the trial court,” Lipton said. In terms of what shareholders should ask of Tesla’s board now, Kastiel said, “Tornetta and recent media reports on Musk have emphasized the importance of accurate and detailed disclosure of the ties between controlling shareholders and directors.” There’s a more fundamental concern at play, Kastiel said, regarding corporate governance in cases where a “superstar CEO” is running the show. “As long as the CEO is perceived as a star and the company depends on the CEO’s vision and leadership, even nominally independent directors — those without strong ties to the CEO — will have difficulty monitoring the CEO’s conduct,” he said. Kastiel also said that the decision likely makes Musk and Tesla more vulnerable to other types of lawsuits. “Plaintiffs may have a better chance of advancing their claims by potentially leveraging the Tornetta findings to argue that the majority of the Tesla board is not independent of Musk,” he said. “To mitigate this risk, Tesla will need to significantly enhance the independence of its board and nominate new independent directors who do not have strong ties to Musk.” WATCH: Elon Musk has a lot of ‘incoming missiles’ from all sides, says Isaacson"}

The market deserves most of the blame for the early move. The S&P 500 was off 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2% after January’s key inflation reading came in hotter than expected. Consumer prices rose 3.1% from the same time last year. Economists were hoping for 2.9%, according to FactSet.\n\nFaster inflation means higher interest rates for longer.

It has been almost exclusively bad news for the EV leader recently. There was a car crash of sorts in its Q4 earnings release and that was followed by a negative ruling for CEO Musk in a lawsuit filed by a shareholder regarding his pay package set by the board in 2018. Meanwhile, demand for EVs has stalled with many concerned the Tesla growth story has hit a brick wall.\n\nHowever, one long-standing Tesla bull is having none of it. Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, a 5-star analyst rated in the top 3% of the Street’s stock pros, acknowledges the current wave of negativity surrounding Tesla as perhaps the most severe in recent memory. However, he stands firm in his conviction, resolutely refusing to join the ranks of the naysayers.\n\n“We could not disagree more with the ultra negative Tesla narrative building and forming a black cloud over the stock,” the 5-star analyst went on to say. “While the next few months are clearly a bit cloudy for the Tesla story and overall EV demand, longer term our view is that by the end of the decade ~20% of autos will be EV with autonomous and FSD a reality and not a dream/aspiration.”\n\nConsidering the stock’s recent poor performance (down 26% year-to-date), Ives believes the stock is “baking in a tremendous amount of bad news here.”\n\nThat said, it is now up to the Board to outline a strategy investors can get behind, with Musk front and center of it. In Ives’ view, the Tesla Board must undertake three actions to “stop this Category 5 hurricane over Tesla’s stock.”\n\nFor one, it needs to introduce a fresh compensation package to replace the 2018 one, alongside a “new package post proxy” to be voted upon at the upcoming shareholder meeting in May. Secondly, the new compensation package should aim to achieve Musk’s targeted 25% voting share. Lastly, Ives supports the idea of Tesla relocating its legal base to Texas, which he believes would facilitate granting Musk the 25% voting rights and the implementation of a revised compensation plan. Moving to Texas, says the analyst, will “take out the uncertainty of Musk and his AI initiatives going anywhere else except under the Tesla hood with a key 3-5 years ahead for the Tesla story.”\n\nAll in, Ives maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating on Tesla shares, to go along with a $315 price target, implying the stock will climb 71% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)\n\nIves is certainly among the Street’s bull contingent but not all are quite as confident. The stock gets a Hold consensus rating, based on a mix of 12 Buys, 17 Holds and 5 Sells. Going by the $220.26 average target, a year from now, the shares will be changing hands for a 20% premium.

The lack of AI tailwinds for Tesla could be pushing the company’s stock down further.\n\nThe stock has decreased by more than 20% for the year, while its “Magnificent Seven” peers have managed to shake off a slow start to 2024.\n\n“That’s part of a growing debate on Wall Street, where shares of Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle maker are tanking as the rest of the market rallies — and the company is warning that things may not get better for a while,” a Yahoo Finance report said, noting that Magnificent Seven stocks have been leading the gains for the S&P 500, while “traders are now wondering if Tesla’s name belongs next to those other powerhouses.”\n\nAs mentioned, one of the reasons could be a direct connection to AI, or in the case of Tesla, a lack thereof. AI’s bright growth prospects are helping companies like Amazon and Microsoft, given their investments in AI technology.\n\n“Although Elon Musk would probably disagree, investors don’t see Tesla as an AI play like most of the other Magnificent Seven stocks,” said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “We have a much different backdrop for Tesla and the others in the Mag Seven — the demand trend for Tesla products is fading, while it’s exploding higher for those companies that are more associated with AI.”\n\nA ‘One Product Company’\n\nAnother challenge that Tesla has compared to its peers is its product diversification. While big tech peers like Amazon can leverage a wide variety of online retail products to offer the masses, that’s not the case with Tesla, according to some analysts. With the demand for electric vehicles (EV) waning as of late, it puts the company in a precarious position.\n\n“The challenge is that Tesla has become a one-product company — the Model Y, with every other initiative either not a meaningful contributor to revenue and earnings or still a bit of a science project,” said Jeffrey Osborne of Cowen. “Being a one-product company and mismanaging the timing of product cycles can create periods of pain, which is what we are in now until the next generation vehicle comes out next year or in 2026.”\n\nIf bearishness persists further, this should help the Direxion Daily TSLA Bear 1X Shares (TSLS). Of course, if Tesla can reverse its bearish trend, traders who see the recent pullback as an opportune time to buy into Tesla’s stock can also take the opposite side of TSLS. For a return to bullishness, they can use the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 1.5X Shares (TSLL).\n\nTSLS data by YCharts\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the Leveraged & Inverse Channel."}

Most see consensus falling and AI ‘off-the-table’ for now.\"\n\nJonas said his “read of the room” from the lunch, a semi-regular gathering Morgan Stanley holds for its institutional clients, revealed that “everyone felt the stock would underperform over 6 months” and almost everyone felt the stock would underperform over the next year. Tesla stock is down a whopping 25% year to date.\n\nJonas cited several reasons for the overall bearishness among clients, one of the biggest being AI and Tesla's exclusion from tech’s AI-related run-up.\n\n“[Tesla CEO] Elon Musk is seen as ‘sidelining’ Tesla from the AI theme for 2024, allowing investors to focus on the deteriorating EV demand narrative,” Jonas wrote.\n\nThis photo taken on Feb. 8, 2024, shows a Tesla Cybertruck at the 2024 Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place in Chicago. (Joel Lerner/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images) More\n\nThis is likely fallout from a string of tweets from Elon Musk in mid-January in which he wrote that he would be “uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.” Many saw this as Musk threatening to siphon off AI efforts into separate companies, thus depriving Tesla of gains made in its AI efforts, and also Musk demanding more compensation in the form of stock grants from the Tesla board.\n\nJonas has written glowingly in the past about Tesla’s AI and supercomputing prowess and has modeled Tesla’s long-term growth using these factors. Jonas noted Morgan Stanley’s valuation of Tesla’s core auto business represents just 22% of the firm’s $345 price target, with Tesla’s other plays like AI, fleet network services and cloud, robotics, software (full self-driving), and supercomputing making up the rest.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, despite the automaker’s efforts in the space (such as using AI to train its full self-driving software), Jonas thinks AI sentiment is so bad at the company that Tesla is “not just ‘excluded’ from the AI trade … but actually on the other side of the AI trade.” The recent performance of the “Magnificent Six” stocks proves that out.\n\nAnother big concern from investors was the possibility of little to no revenue growth — something that seemed unheard of given Tesla’s performance over the years.\n\nElon Musk addresses the European Jewish Association's conference in Krakow, Poland, on Monday, Jan. 22, 2024. (Czarek Sokolowski/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Investors questioned whether there was a possibility that Tesla may not grow volume vs the Q4 run-rate of 2 [million] units,\" Jonas wrote. “For a name where its management team was recently targeting 50% top line CAGR (compound annual growth rate) [in annual deliveries], the change in sentiment on growth was not lost on the group.”\n\nIndeed, while Tesla did report 484,507 deliveries in Q4, representing an all-time record quarter for Tesla, management did warn that the \"vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.\" Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries grew 38% to 1.81 million, while production grew 35% to 1.85 million.\n\nDespite the overall tone at the lunch, Jonas reiterated Morgan Stanley’s Overweight rating and $345 price target on the stock, representing an 80% upside for shares from current levels. In order to deliver that kind of upside, however, Tesla will have to overcome issues not just facing EV makers but the larger auto sector too, such as higher interest rates, higher costs, and supply gluts.\n\n“We acknowledge FY24 will be a challenging year for the global auto industry, which is reflected in our estimates,\" he said.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Figuring out what has been driving shares can be difficult for investors. Figuring out why the shares have declined so much is a relatively easy task.\n\nThe answer lies in the wisdom of crowds. Look at Wall Street earnings estimates. They are the numerical reflection of all the news impacting any company— Tesla included.\n\nComing into Wednesday, Tesla stock had fallen 26% this year while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite had both risen about 4%. It’s the worst start for Tesla shares since 2016 when they dropped almost 40% over a similar span to start that year.\n\nThe drop this year is steep, but the size of it makes a lot of sense. The current consensus call for Tesla’s 2024 earnings per share is about $3.08, according to FactSet. The estimate started the year at about $3.84. Estimates have come down about 20%. The fall closely mirrors what Tesla stock has done within a few percentage points.\n\nLooking back to October—just before Tesla stock dropped 9.3% after the electric-vehicle company reported third-quarter earnings —Wall Street’s earnings estimate for 2024 was roughly $4.50 a share. The estimate is down about 30% since then. Tesla stock has fallen about 24% over the same span.\n\nAnalysts don’t change just one estimate at a time. Wall Street’s 2025 earnings estimates are down as well, roughly 20% lower since the start of the year. Taking a longer view, 2025 estimates peaked north of $8 a share in December 2022. They are down 50% since then to $4.23 a share. Tesla stock has fallen 55% from its record closing high of just under $410 a share reached in November 2021.\n\nEstimate revisions are a useful tool for investors to check if stock moves make sense. When they line up—as they have with Tesla lately—it’s a sign that investors are worried about company fundamentals. When revisions and the stock moves don’t line up, it’s a signal that something else is on investors’ minds.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nRemember Twitter? Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he had made a bid for Twitter in April 2022. From that tweet, through the end of that year, Tesla stock dropped some 60%. Wall Street’s estimates for 2023 earnings—stocks always trade on future earnings—rose from about $4.68 to $5.59 a share over the same span.\n\nThe divergence shows that Musk’s Twitter distraction bothered Tesla investors. After those fears faded, Tesla stock doubled in 2023 despite vehicle price cuts and rising interest rates.\n\nTo be sure, estimate revisions can’t do everything for investors. They can’t tell them exactly what is going on at a company. There are many reasons Tesla’s earnings estimates have been coming down. For starters, there are those price cuts that have hurt profit margins. And those higher interest rates have made all cars more expensive for buyers. There also is more EV competition around the globe and Tesla doesn’t look like it will have a lower-priced model that can help expand its addressable market until 2025.\n\nThose are some of the headwinds the company faces. Those headwinds have been evaluated by more than 40 analysts, resulting in lower earnings estimates. Investors have reacted to those reduced estimates by sending Tesla stock lower.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nOn a very basic level, that’s how the stock market is supposed to work.\n\nTesla stock got some of its losses back in Wednesday trading. Shares rose 2.6% to $188.71 while the S&P 500 rose 1%."}

FREDERIC J. BROWN/Getty Images\n\n“Just back from easily the most bearish of our Tesla bull bear lunches … but for admittedly understandable reasons,\" Jonas wrote. \"We expected bearishness from institutional investors given recent negative sentiment on the name, but there was barely any attempt to argue for a near-term bull case.\"\n\n\"From our read of the room, it seemed that everyone felt the stock would underperform over six months,\" he added. \"Almost everyone felt the stock would underperform over 12 months.\"\n\nShort-sellers are long on profits\n\nThat view is also reflected in the level of short bets lining up against the stock.\n\nShort-sellers bet against a company by borrowing shares and selling them. If the price of the stock declines, the short-sellers will buy back the shares at a lower price, return the borrowed stock (while paying a fee), and pocket the difference.\n\nData from S3 Partners, which tracks a host of short-selling data across all the major U.S. indexes, suggest that bets against Tesla have been the most profitable market play this year.\n\nBets against Tesla have short-sellers earning around $4.54 billion, S3 Partners noted, while those betting against its much smaller EV rival Rivian Automotive (RIVN) have earned around $710 million.\n\nOverall, however, U.S. short-sellers are down more than $16.7 billion (before yesterday's broad-market slump) and have trimmed their exposure by around $3.55 billion over the past 30 days.\n\nShort interest in Tesla remains elevated, though, with bets against the group estimated at around $16.4 billion, or just under 85 million shares. That's around 3.07% of Tesla's float outstanding.\n\nTesla: warning signs and waning demand\n\nTesla has displayed some concern for the coming year, warning investors in January that vehicle-delivery growth rates would be \"notably lower\" than 2023 levels while unveiling a series of price cuts in major markets worldwide.\n\nThe group also hinted at pending U.S. layoffs last week amid reports that performance reviews for some employees have been canceled, and managers have been asked to make a \"binary\" assessment of roles across the company.\n\nBut Jonas remains bullish on Tesla for a reason, noting that only a fifth of his $345 price target – which he lowered from $380 last month – is based on the group's core automotive division.\n\n\"Negative developments in the global EV market very much matter to Tesla and should reasonably have a negative near-term impact on the price of the stock,\" Jonas said.\n\n\"At the same time, however, we believe investors should not ignore the continued developments of Tesla's other plays, many of which are auto-related (i.e., the recurring revenue opportunity from the Tesla fleet, which is embedded in our Tesla Network Services valuation),\" he added.\n\nMusk seemed far more animated when speaking about his ambitions for Tesla's development of full self-driving and AI technologies. He described the company as sitting in the midst of \"two major growth waves,\" the latter of which will be \"driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, Full Self-Driving, and other projects.\"\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter is also concerned about the impact of Tesla's price cuts and the group's \"aging product lineup.\" Last week, he trimmed his price target on Tesla by $70 to $225 a share, but he sees value in the potential revenue generation from its growing energy business.\n\nPotter values Tesla's automotive division, excluding its Full Self-Driving driver-assistance system, at around $135 a share, with the rest of his $225 target tied to Tesla energy.\n\nAI 'off the table' as a Tesla value driver: Investors\n\nTesla's energy division, which sells energy storage and solar energy systems, saw fourth-quarter revenue rise 10% from 2022 to around $1.31 billion. The full-year tally was just over $6 billion, a 54% gain from 2022 levels.\n\nJonas at Morgan Stanley also noted that investors at the investment bank's lunch meeting said artificial intelligence is \"off the table\" for now as a driver of Tesla's value, given that \"an improving EV narrative is seen as a prerequisite for investors to underwrite the AI story.\"\n\nMusk has made no secret of his longer-term vision for Tesla and its ability to leverage AI technologies. Last month, he said he would need to build his AI and robotics vision outside the Tesla structure unless he could acquire at least a 25% voting stake in the group.\n\nTesla shares rose 2.55% higher Wednesday, against a 1.3% advance for the Nasdaq benchmark, to close at $188.71 each, trimming the stock's one-month decline to around 14.2% and valuing the Austin, Texas-based carmaker at around $591 billion."}

Its losing EV market share in the U.S. CEO Elon Musk reportedly has a drug problem so bad his board member friends want him to go to rehab. And Musk is at risk of losing his status as the world’s richest person, with Jeff Bezos catching up as he sells Amazon stock and Musk is losing ground as Tesla stock sinks to the bottom of the S&P 500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch, on the other hand, had a great year last year that isn’t slowing down. Its stock even beat chipmaker and Wall Street darling Nvidia, plus its turnaround strategy positioned it well to take advantage of rising consumer spending.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser website GO TO PAGE PLAY Top Stories\n\nIs Abercrombie a “technology” company? Not exactly.\n\nBut stock groupings that get nicknames are all arbitrary anyway. Amazon is a logistics company. Apple makes gadgets. Meta makes alternate universes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut ooh, look! Last year, Abercrombie chief digital officer Samir Desai told an audience at the CommerceNext conference that artificial intelligence is an increasingly important part of his company’s business.\n\n“We feed [the tech] historical images of products that have sold really well and use prompts to iterate and refine and base a new line off of that,” he said. “It’s driving inspiration, it’s driving velocity and how quickly [the team] can produce product images.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee! There you go.\n\nTesla out.\n\nAbercrombie in.\n\nHappy trading."}

While the tech-heavy has tacked on almost 10% since the first week of January, shares of electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) have sunk more than 20%. And the worst part for Tesla investors is that it hasn’t been just a flash in the pan, where shares opened up that far down on the back of unexpected bad news. No, instead, it’s been a slow but steady drift south since last summer in what is increasingly looking like a downtrend from 2021’s high, as Tesla finds itself catching a cold as the EV winter has set in.\n\nFor a stock that could seemingly do no wrong for a long time, it’s an unfortunate turn of events but one that shows no company is immune from a dramatic change in its fortunes. Some of the main headwinds that CEO Elon Musk and his company have been tackling include a weak margin outlook and ongoing price cuts amid stiff competition from China. A weak earnings report from last month spooked investors, and there’s a good bit of work to be done in order to restore investor confidence.\n\nConsidering the upside potential\n\nBut for those of us on the sidelines, you have to be wondering at what point Tesla becomes too cheap to ignore. Already, we’re seeing some of the heavyweight names in the tech space come to its defense, with the likes of ARK’s Cathie Woods acknowledging that it’s having a bad time right now but also saying we’re close to seeing the low in its cycle.\n\nFor Woods, there are just too many tailwinds and key industry catalysts waiting around the corner for Tesla to remain unwanted. She mentioned autonomous taxi networks as an example of a new industry just waiting to take off in the coming years and one that Tesla is positioned well to capitalize on. There’s every reason to think we’ll see a strong bounce in their margin performance as the company reaccelerates into growth mode.\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives has also come to Tesla’s defense in recent weeks. In particular, he pushed back hard on the bears who are going around acting as if the EV evolution is dead and over, writing in a note to clients that “we could not disagree more with the ultra negative Tesla narrative building and forming a black cloud over the stock.” Like Woods, he’s not expecting an immediate turnaround, with some industry-wide headwinds still to be navigated, but in the long term, you nearly couldn’t pick a better stock. By the end of the decade, Wedbush expects somewhere around 20% of all cars to be EVs, with autonomous driving an almost basic feature for consumers at that point.\n\nLong term outlook\n\nIves and his team reiterated their Outperform rating on Tesla shares at the end of last month and gave them a fresh price target of $315. Considering Tesla closed at $184 on Tuesday night, that’s a targeted upside of some 70%, which is not to be sniffed at. The Piper Sandler team has also come out bullish on Tesla’s prospects over the long term and, just last week reiterated their own Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nFor those of us considering a position, getting involved here will require an iron stomach and a desire to hold for a while. The recent bout of price cuts has damaged the company’s margins beyond what many were expecting, and there’s an ugly dispute emerging between Musk and the board over voting control. But for a stock that once commanded a four-digit price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, seeing it trade with a PE ratio of just 42 is almost hard to believe. With its stock back trading at 2020 levels and interest rates looking like they’ve topped out, we’re inclined to say these prices won’t be around for much longer. If you’re a believer in the EV industry, then this could be the time to start backing up the truck.\n\nOriginal Post"}

With that in mind, maybe it wasn’t the best idea for Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas to meet with investors over lunch. The analyst must have braced himself for a skeptical audience, given the prevailing negative sentiment. However, what unfolded during the meeting was more daunting than he had anticipated.\n\n“We expected bearishness from institutional investors given recent negative sentiment on the name,” says the analyst. “But there was barely any attempt to argue for a near-term bull case. From our read of the room, it seemed that everyone felt the stock would underperform over 6 months. Almost everyone felt the stock would underperform over 12 months.”\n\nSome investors wondered whether any actual sales growth will take place this year. Tesla exited Q4 at a run-rate approaching 2 million units, but the specter of declining sales was also raised. “For a name where its management team was recently targeting 50% top line CAGR, the change in sentiment on growth was not lost on the group,” Jonas noted.\n\nFurthermore, investors think Elon Musk is diverting attention away from Tesla’s involvement in the current AI theme, shifting focus to concerns about declining demand for EVs. Meanwhile, there’s also a belief that a positive narrative regarding EVs is necessary to “underwrite the AI story.”\n\nJonas reiterated to the group that his forecast for FY24 is for adj. EPS of $2.04, which is actually below consensus at over $3 per share. Although there wasn’t much disagreement with his forecast, which he believes aligns with institutional expectations, the group still anticipated that the stock could respond badly to the possibility of “negative consensus earnings revisions.”\n\nJonas, however, has been an unwavering TSLA bull, but has the encounter deflated him in some way? Not in the slightest. “Negative developments in the global EV market very much matter to Tesla and should reasonably have a negative near-term impact on the price of the stock,” he said, before getting his bull hat back on. “At the same time, however, we believe investors should not ignore the continued developments of Tesla’s other plays, many of which are auto-related (i.e. the recurring revenue opportunity from the Tesla fleet – embedded in our Tesla Network Services valuation) and other areas that we do not include within our $345 target but that the market may include (i.e. Optimus) which we expect to learn much more about during the 2024 Tesla AI day (date TBD).”\n\nThat $345 price target remains the Street’s highest and is set to deliver big returns of 72% over the coming months. It hardly needs mentioning, but Jonas’ rating stays an Overweight (i.e., Buy). (To watch Jonas’ track record, click here)\n\nAmongst Jonas’ colleagues, 17 remain on the sidelines, 11 join him in the bull camp, and 5 say Sell, all coalescing to a Hold consensus rating. Most, however, see some upside here; the $220.26 average target represents one-year gains of ~10%.

Intrepid investors might want to look at stocks to short, or bet against, instead.\n\nThe S&P 500 has risen 22% since a multimonth low at the end of October. The rally has included not just Big Tech—which has become increasingly expensive —but many other sectors as well. So while there are certainly stocks that could climb higher on better-than-expected profits, many shares have plenty of room to fall if the earnings picture darkens.\n\nInvestors could make money from those potential drops with short positions, which profit from a stock’s decline. In a successful short bet, an investor borrows someone else’s shares and immediately sells them. After the stock falls, they buy the shares back at a lower price and return them to generate a profit.\n\nTo be sure, short selling isn’t for the faint of heart. Stocks, over long periods of time, tend to rise. To make money, a short seller must be right that the price will fall within a specific time frame—usually just six months. And if a positive catalyst sends a shorted stock rapidly higher, short sellers can be forced to buy the stock to cover their bets quickly, making it an especially risky trade where losses can accumulate quickly. (During the height of the meme trade in 2021, GameStop stock was a poster child for the so-called short squeeze.)\n\nThis week, analysts at Wolfe Research published a screen of stocks that look like good short candidates. The screen included names with valuations that are arguably too high relative to the companies’ earnings potential. Consistent with that, the stocks had to have poor earnings quality, or a low predictability of earnings.\n\nThe screen includes Plug Power, ADT, Tesla, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Hasbro, and ViaSat.\n\nCurrent market positioning for these six suggests they could see more short selling in particular.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nMany of the screen’s stocks also have relatively large debt loads. Walgreens is one example.\n\nThe company has more than $30 billion in liabilities net of cash, which includes debt and lease obligations—that figure is more than six times Walgreen’s expected 2024 Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). In comparison, many S&P 500 companies have debt-to-Ebitda ratios around one or two times, seen as less risky. In other words, Walgreens’ profits don’t cover its debts as well as other companies. Those debt levels will look even riskier if the profits keep falling as they have for the past several years.\n\nIn addition, the stock isn’t necessarily a good deal, despite its 40% drop over the past 12 months.\n\nWalgreen’s valuation looks like a bargain on the surface: The company’s enterprise value is about 6 times expected 2024 Ebitda versus the S&P 500’s 13 times. But behind that multiple is a decline in profits over the past several years that investors wan the company to turn around. Plus, the majority of the company’s Ebitda goes out the door toward expenditures: In 2023, $4.9 billion of Ebitda translated into less than $1 billion of free cash flow.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThese are all reasons short sellers could come back into the name, especially since only about 5.1% of Walgreens’ shares outstanding are shorted right now, according to Wolfe Research. Heavily-shorted stocks can often have closer to 50% short interest. If the company doesn’t turn around the profit picture, the stock will suffer.\n\nWalgreens declined to comment.\n\nHasbro is another stock that looks cheap at first glance, but it could also be perceived as too pricey. It trades at 15 times expected earnings per share for 2024, compared with 20 times for the S&P 500. Hasbro’s multiple might seem a bit too expensive, however, when considering the quality of its earnings. The toy maker’s per-share earnings have declined in the past few years. This year’s expected per-share earnings, for instance, would be below 2019’s result. Continued earnings weakness could lead to further stock declines. Hasbro stock has dropped 13% over the past 12 months.\n\nThe company’s net debt is also about three times expected Ebitda for 2024, a larger multiple than that of the S&P 500.\n\nThese are factors that, unless the company either grows its profits or reduces debt, could attract short sellers. Only about 5.6% of the shares are shorted right now.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nHasbro pointed B arron’s to its executives’ comments about recent product successes on the company’s most recent earnings call.

First, growth stocks have rarely been “cheap” over the last decade; and second, after the largely unexpected rally over the last year, broad-market valuations appear somewhat stretched, if anything.\n\nHowever, I believe SoFi (SOFI) and Tesla (TSLA) are two growth stocks worth buying this February. Both of these stocks offer strong growth prospects over the next decade, and their valuations are also lower than historical averages.\n\nSoFi: A Cheap Growth Stock in the Fintech Industry\n\nSoFi has grown into a financial services powerhouse, and reported a stellar set of numbers in Q4 that set record highs on several metrics. For instance, the company’s revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and net interest margin all hit a record high in the quarter. Its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin was also in line with the long-term target of 30%, and it posted its first profitable quarter on a GAAP basis.\n\nThe company’s 2024 guidance was equally impressive, and it expects the combined revenues of the Tech Platform and Financial Services segments to rise by at least 50% YoY. SoFi also predicted that lending revenues would hover between 92% and 95% of 2023 levels.\n\nManagement anticipates its adjusted EBITDA margins to rise to 30% by year-end, implying annual adjusted EBITDA between $580 million and $590 million. It also guided for full-year GAAP earnings per share (EPS) between $0.07-$0.08 - which, if achieved, would mark the first full year of GAAP profitability for the company.\n\nSoFi expects its revenues to grow at a CAGR of 20%-25% between 2023 and 2026, with GAAP EPS expected to be between $0.55-$0.80 in 2026. It further expects GAAP EPS to rise between 20%-25% post-2026, as well.\n\nThese long-term forecasts should always be taken with a grain of salt, as practically all of the companies that went public through special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) mergers, as SoFi did, are nowhere near the lofty targets they set before their mergers.\n\nThat said, SoFi is the exception to the rule here, as the company’s top-line performance has been in line with the numbers it cited ahead of SPAC merger, even as it missed out on the $200 million GAAP profit that it had forecast for 2023.\n\nSoFi Stock Forecast Is Bullish\n\nWhile Wall Street is not really bullish on SoFi – it has a consensus rating of “Hold” from the 21 analysts covering the stock – I find the stock’s outlook quite positive.\n\nSoFi has grown its top line without compromising on credit quality and profitability. And at a time when many former growth stocks are finding it tough to report even single-digit growth in revenues, SoFi brings strong double-digit top-line and bottom-line growth to the table.\n\nFinally, with a next 12-month (NTM) price-to-sales multiple of 3.5x, SoFi’s valuation leaves room for further upside if the company can deliver on the kind of EPS growth that it is projecting.\n\nTesla Stock: It Makes Sense to Buy the Dip\n\nTesla stock has underperformed the markets in 2024, after more than doubling in 2023. In the short term, the Tesla growth story is looking a bit tarnished after the company warned that its 2024 deliveries “may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.”\n\nWith the Cybertruck still a long way from mass production, and the new low-cost model yet to be announced, Tesla lacks any real short-term growth drivers. The macro environment hasn't been favorable either, with the slowdown in China – Tesla’s biggest overseas market – seeming to worsen by the day. Investor sentiment toward EV stocks is also quite tepid, as demand growth is not as strong as most believed it would be.\n\nThat said, I believe while Tesla is facing short-term headwinds, its growth should rebound in 2025 and beyond as it launches new models, especially the long-awaited low-cost model. Also, the next round of growth in Tesla could come through autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) products.\n\nTesla Stock Looks Cheap at These Levels\n\nFinally, from a valuation perspective, New York University finance professor Ashwath Damodaran valued Tesla at $183.75 earlier this month. In fact, his analysis showed that Tesla and Meta Platforms (META) were among the “least overvalued” among the mega-cap group of “Magnificent 7” stocks. The “dean of valuation” found Nvidia (NVDA) to be the most overvalued among the group, followed by Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nWhile Tesla shares trade slightly ahead of what Damodaran believes is their fair value, I believe the stock is quite cheap, even as the NTM price-to-earnings (PE) multiple of nearly 63x might not seem to suggest as much - at least, not at first sight.\n\nThe recent dip in Tesla looks like a good opportunity to buy the shares, as it still remains one of the most consequential companies of our times, with a presence in multiple exciting industries like electric cars, renewable energy, autonomous driving, robotics, and supercomputers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: TSLA , SOFI , NVDA , META , MSFT .

Toyota’s revenue and earnings are roughly three times larger at $299 billion and $44 billion. Yet Tesla’s market cap is more than double that of Toyota.\n\nTesla shares have soared since going public, while Toyota and other major auto manufacturers’ shares have meandered along. Since going public in 2010 at $1.59 (split adjusted), Tesla shares are up nearly 12,000%. That figure is more stunning, considering it’s down 50% since late 2021. The graph below, charting the two stocks since 2018, highlights Tesla’s outperformance versus Toyota and the extreme volatility of its returns. As shown in the second graph, 40-50+% drawdowns are not uncommon for Tesla.\n\nTesla shares have outperformed Toyota’s and the market because of the significant growth of EVs, a robust outlook for EV market penetration, and forecasts that Tesla will maintain its lead role in manufacturing EVs. Tesla’s market cap relies on all three coming to fruition.\n\nWhat if one or more of those do not occur? Might hybrids be the preferred technology until a more efficient battery evolves? Will EV competition from established and new auto manufacturers upend Tesla’s market share? Maybe most critical, could Toyota, not Tesla, be at the forefront of a significant technological advance for automobiles?\n\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of 9 for Toyota and 72 for Tesla, the answers to our questions have critical implications for shareholders of both stocks.\n\nEVs VS ICE\n\nSales of EVs are multiplying. The latest data shows that EVs will account for 9% of all domestic new car sales in 2024. That leaves plenty of upside for EV manufacturers if the U.S. follows the path of other countries like Germany and China, in which EVs represent approximately a third of all new car sales.\n\nWhile the transition from internal combustion engines (ICE) to electric is sure to continue, its pace appears to be moderating. There are a few drawbacks affecting the uptake of EVs.\n\nStory continues\n\nEV Drawbacks\n\nConsider the following:\n\nFewer EV cars are eligible for Federal tax credits.\n\nKelley Blue Book claims the five-year cost to own EVs versus ICE vehicles is 15% higher.\n\nThe time to “fill up” an EV is much longer than an ICE car, and the EV recharging infrastructure is inadequate in many places. Consequently, “range anxiety,” or the fear of running out of power at the wrong time or location, is a concern.\n\nPer the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA)- The final cost of the vehicle is its depreciation at resell, the difference between what the consumer paid for it and its worth after five years of ownership. EVs lose an average of $43,515 in value; ICE vehicles depreciate by $27,883.\n\nEV batteries are less efficient in severe temperatures.\n\nEVs have higher insurance and financing costs.\n\nLithium-ion batteries can catch fire in an accident and on rare occasions when they are not in use.\n\nThe obvious benefit for EV owners is fuel costs. NADA estimates an EV owner will save approximately $5,000 in gas and a few hundred dollars in maintenance costs over five years versus an ICE owner.\n\nThe market for EVs among early adapters and wealthier, environmentally concerned consumers is starting to get saturated. More car buyers will likely shift from ICE to EV, but that transition will be slower than it has been for the more eager first adapters.\n\nTesla Doesn’t Have a Monopoly Anymore\n\nAt one point, Tesla’s market cap was almost equal to that of the entire auto industry. Not only were Tesla investors projecting that Tesla would be the largest automaker, but also that some of their other ventures, like energy generation and robo-taxis would do fabulously well. A lot has changed since then.\n\nTesla no longer has a monopoly on EVs. Almost every auto manufacturer, and a few new ones like Rivian and Fisker, now manufactures EV cars, as shown in the graph below, courtesy of Cox Automotive.\n\nFurther, consider the following paragraph from Cox Automotive:\n\nEV transaction prices in Q3 were down significantly from 2022. In an attempt to increase sales volume, Tesla slashed prices, which are now down roughly 25% year over year. The price cuts have helped, as Tesla’s Q3 sales grew by 19.5% year over year, surpassing the industry’s overall growth rate of 16.3%. However, Tesla’s share of the EV segment continues to plunge, hitting 50% in Q3, the lowest level on record and down from 62% in Q1.\n\nBottom line: Tesla is losing its competitive advantage. They are relinquishing EV market share and cutting prices, ergo profits, to stay competitive.\n\nHybrid- The Bridge Technology\n\nThis discussion of hybrid automobiles does not refer to models with gas engines and battery packs that can be plugged into a power source.\n\nAs shown in the graph above, Toyota lags every other automaker, with only 0.5% of sales coming from EVs. However, Toyota has a different strategy regarding producing environmentally friendly vehicles. They are the largest seller of hybrid cars. The hybrid Prius was introduced to the U.S. market in 2000. Toyota’s first mover experience gives them a unique advantage in profitably manufacturing hybrid vehicles.\n\nHybrid automobiles can get 35 to 50+ miles per gallon. The technology enables a battery to capture a charge through its braking mechanism. This electricity then supplements its internal combustion engine. Consumer Reports estimates hybrids provide a 40% improvement in gas mileage versus non-hybrids.\n\nThe graphic below, courtesy of CNBC, shows that U.S. sales of hybrids have easily kept up with EV sales since 2015.\n\nCar owners prefer better gas mileage, and we presume many want to do their part to help the environment. That said, most auto consumers are not ready to fully commit to EVs. We listed some reasons for the hesitation, but likely the most important is the price. The CNBC graphic below shows hybrids and ICE vehicles are similar in price, while EVs are costlier.\n\nWe think hybrid vehicles can be the transitional technology of choice until a better EV battery evolves. Many consumers seem to agree!\n\nMore On Hybrids\n\nThe following is from a recent Wall Street Journal article entitled, Toyota Motor reports rise in quarterly net profit as sales grew.\n\nExecutives at Japanese automakers that are strong in hybrids, including Toyota and Honda, say they are skeptical of competitors’ ability to catch up quickly. They observe that it took some two decades for Japanese carmakers to bring their hybrids to profit-margin parity with purely gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\nHybrid sales grew last year at a faster clip than sales for pure electric vehicles in the U.S. and some other markets. Signs have emerged that the EV push might have gotten ahead of U.S. consumers who are worried about charging problems and higher prices. That has steered them toward less expensive hybrids, which can be filled up with gasoline.\n\nAutomakers that had been rushing to pivot toward full EVs are now reconsidering.\n\nGeneral Motors said last week it would introduce some plug-in hybrid models in North America after facing pressure from dealers.\n\nFord Motor said last year it would seek to quadruple its hybrid sales in the next five years.\n\nSolid-State Batteries\n\nWe now consider the next potential game changer for the auto industry: solid-state batteries. Solid-state batteries promise to eliminate many problems associated with current EV lithium-ion batteries.\n\nLithium-ion batteries are heavy, expensive to manufacture, slow to charge, and have a mileage range considered too short by many. Solid-state batteries vastly improve on those problems. However, whether the technology can be mass-produced at reasonable costs is unclear.\n\nMany experts believe Toyota is the leader in solid-state battery development. Per Forbes:\n\nToyota’s stated goal is for their solid-state batteries to ultimately have a range of >1,200km, and to go from 10 – 80% charge in 10 minutes or less. This compares to the Tesla Model Y, which currently has a range of 542 km, and fast-charges in 27 minutes.\n\nOther automakers are investing in solid-state battery development. Toyota believes they will be the first to produce cars with solid-state batteries. Production could come as early as 2027. The investment and production costs are enormous, and there are no promises these batteries will make economic sense for consumers or manufacturers.\n\nTesla does not believe in the viability of solid-state technology, and, as far as the market knows, it is not developing solid-state batteries.\n\nTesla 4680 Battery Cells\n\nElon Musk is an innovator. He knows that his current battery technology will fall behind his competitors if it is not improved. Tesla is betting on 4680 batteries instead of solid-state. The 4680 battery hopes to improve cost, weight, and energy density.\n\nPer evlithium.com, the potential benefits are battery weight, which may be about 10% lighter. Additionally, the cost of the batteries could be 15% cheaper, and the driving distance on a charge could improve by 10-15%.\n\nSuch would be a decent improvement, but it pales compared to the promise of solid-state batteries.\n\nFundamentals and Valuations\n\nSo, with an appreciation for the role of hybrids, EVs, and solid-state batteries, let’s compare Toyota to Tesla and better appreciate their comparative valuations and fundamentals.\n\nValuations\n\nBefore looking at the valuation comparisons below, consider that Tesla is a high-growth company while Toyota is mature. Toyota is the world’s largest auto manufacturer, while Tesla is ranked 15th. Given its smaller size, it is much easier for Tesla to gain global market share. The potential for outsized growth is reflected in the valuations. Tesla trades at valuations 6-8 times that of Toyota, implying 6-8x excess growth for Tesla over the long run.\n\nThe PEG ratio, however, tells a different story. The PEG ratio divides each company’s P/E ratio by its 3-5-year expected earnings growth. The ratio helps normalize the P/E ratio for companies with varying growth rates.\n\nBased on the P/E and the PEG ratio, the market implies earnings growth of 19.05% for Toyota and 12.44% for Tesla.\n\nFundamentals\n\nIn addition to growing more rapidly than Toyota, Tesla is more operationally and financially efficient. EV cars have fewer parts, making assembly quicker and cheaper. Additionally, Tesla’s revenue and earnings benefit from EV credits. Lastly, Tesla generates revenue from other sources. While not currently sizable, they skew the data and forecasts.\n\nToyota’s revenue has been relatively stagnant over the last five years, while Tesla has grown by 33% a year on average. Tesla’s cash flow growth is challenging to gauge as they are heavily reinvesting into production and R&D, as shown by the tremendous growth in its capital expenditures. Another indication that the companies are in different lifecycle stages is Tesla’s lack of dividends compared to Toyota’s healthy 3.55% yield.\n\nTesla has much less long-term debt than Toyota. However, if they are to continue growing rapidly, debt will likely grow accordingly.\n\nBetting On The Future\n\nInvesting in Tesla or Toyota is a bet on the future of automobiles.\n\nTesla shareholders hope the company will continue improving EV technology, expanding its charging network, and gain valuable market share. Importantly, it’s a wager that some version of the current lithium-ion battery technology is the future of EVs. Tesla has other non-manufacturing ventures that may also be very profitable.\n\nToyota investors will do well if the company maintains its leadership in ICE vehicles and its hybrid models continue to gain market share. Further, if solid-state batteries are the preferred EV battery, then Toyota may have a huge leg up on Tesla and the industry.\n\nToyota has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 9, less than half of the S&P 500 and well below Tesla’s 72. It appears that Toyota offers a conservative investment in the state of the current auto industry with a potentially valuable option for the future via its considerable investment in solid-state batteries.\n\nIf solid-state batteries prove to be the next step in EVs, Toyota may be the next Tesla. In such a case, Tesla may struggle if they don’t adapt to comparable technology. However, if solid-state technology is too costly, Tesla may continue to gain market share and meet the lofty goals of its shareholders.\n\nIt’s worth disclaiming that other potential technologies, such as hydrogen, exist. While we don’t discount them, we limit this discussion to what is probable over the coming five years.\n\nSummary\n\nToyota appreciates hybrid vehicles’ role in transitioning to more energy-efficient transportation. While losing the EV battle, they make up for it in hybrid sales. More importantly, they may have a better EV battery within a few years. If Toyota can continue to dominate the hybrid space and make significant inroads into EVs later this decade via a solid-state battery, its stock is cheap.\n\nTesla is a bet on Elon Musk and his proven ability to innovate. Not only did he start the EV revolution, but he is at the forefront of other exciting technologies. How those fold into Tesla is unknown.\n\nWhile Musk has proven to be a great horse to bet on, Tesla’s price is very high. At a P/E of 72 and a PEG ratio more than 10x its competitors, Tesla investors are hoping for continued tremendous growth. Importantly, they are betting that Tesla will take significant market share from well-established automakers.\n\nGiven all he has accomplished, it’s hard to bet against Elon Musk. However, we think Toyota may be the safer investment and the stock with more upside.\n\nBy Zerohedge.com\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n\nRead this article on OilPrice.com"}

Over O’Neils long and illustrious career, he made a fortune investing in the hottest, most innovative growth stocks of the day, and more importantly, selling them near the top. Over his multi-decade career, O’Neil made millions in novel ideas and companies such as Price Company (which later became Costco, online marketplace Ebay, EV-pioneer Tesla.\n\nIt’s About What You Keep\n\nOnce a growth investor takes time-tested principles like growing earnings, a bullish chart pattern, and a growing industry into account, making money in the market becomes not only possible, but repeatable. However, buying winning stocks is not the issue for the majority of investors. After all, a baby can pick Scrabble letters out of a bag and potentially find a winner.\n\nThe hard part of investing is selling stocks; especially those that are moving in your favor rapidly. O’Neil was genius at doing this: He rode internet-related stocks like Qualcomm higher for months before selling them near the absolute top. How was O’Neil able to pull off such a feat? By studying hundreds of winning stocks and their topping patterns.\n\n“The pockets change, the suckers change, the stocks change, but Wall Street never changes, because human nature never changes.” ~ Jesse Livermore\n\nThe Climax Top\n\nThough O’Neil had several sell signals, today we are going to focus on a sell signal that is relevant to today’s environment. Below is a blurb from O’Neil himself on Climax Tops:\n\n“Many leading stocks top in an explosive fashion. They make climax runs – suddenly advancing at a much faster rate for one or two weeks after an advance of many months. In addition, they often end in exhaustion gaps – when a stock’s price opens up on a gap from the prior day’s close, on heavy volume.”\n\nStory continues\n\nKey Rules of the Climax Top\n\n1. Largest daily price run-up: A cautionary sign occurs when a stock that has rallied for months experiences its largest point increase in the move.\n\n2. Heaviest daily volume: Extreme volume is a signal that trapped shorts have capitulated, while amateur longs chased the extended stock.\n\n3. Exhaustion gap: If a stock gaps up (trades higher in after-hours trading) multiple times, the advance is on its last leg.\n\n4. Climax top activity: “Sell if a stock’s advance gets so active that it has a rapid price run-up for two or three weeks on a weekly chart, or for seven of eight days in a row or eight of ten days on a daily chart.”\n\n1999 QCOM Case Study\n\nIn 1999, no hotter stock existed than semi-conductor maker Qualcomm.As the internet craze went into a frenzy, QCOM ran from ~$6 to $200 in a year! Sure enough, the move came to an end in a classic climax top:\n\n1. Largest point spread: On December 29, 1999 QCOM gained $39 points in a single session, marking its largest point spread to that point.\n\n2. Heaviest daily volume: Though QCOM didn’t trade its highest volume ever, volume on 12/29 soared 142% versus the 50-day average and was the heaviest volume in weeks.\n\n3. Exhaustion gap: After running for months, QCOM gapped up in price from an extended move. ***(It’s important to decipher a gap up from a base (healthy) from a gap up from an extended move (exhaustion))***\n\n4. Climax top activity: From 12/13/1999 to 12/21/999 QCOM shares gained ground for seven straight sessions – a red flag.\n\nBelow is the 1999 QCOM example marked up. A good exercise is to look at each data point and match them up to the chart and the commentary.\n\nAfter topping in January 2000, QCOM shares would not see their climax top highs for another twenty years!\n\nSuper Micro Computer:Shades of QCOM in 99’?\n\nLike QCOM in 1999, SMCI is a clear leader in today’s market. Over the past fiver years SMCI is up nearly 5,000%. Year-to-date (keep in mind we are in February), the bull trend has accelerated, and shares are up a mind-blowing 250%!

Year-to-date, shares of the magnificent seven member have declined by almost 20% and nearly 15% over the previous three months.\n\nIt’s a rare underperformance for the company as it has historically outperformed the overall market. However, that hasn’t been the case, as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust NYSE: SPY, a benchmark for the market, is up over 5% year-to-date. The technology sector, Invesco QQQ ETF NASDAQ: QQQ, also increased by over 5% during the same period.\n\nGet Tesla alerts: Sign Up\n\nHowever, might the tide be turning for shares of Tesla after the stock posted a green week last week, closing up over 3%? After beginning the week flat and holding above prior support, the stock rallied into the end of the week to post a modest gain. The recent action in Tesla, together with the overall market trading near all-time highs, beckons the question: Has Tesla bottomed, and is now the time to buy?\n\nLet’s take a closer look.\n\nTesla’s recent earnings and current valuation\n\nTesla released its quarterly earnings data on January 24th, 2024, reporting $0.71 per share per quarter, falling short of analysts' consensus estimates of $0.75 by $0.04. Despite revenues of $25.17 billion during the quarter, slightly below analyst predictions of $25.64 billion, the company's quarterly revenue saw a 3.5% increase compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nWith a current price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 46 and $4.31 earnings per share over the last year, Tesla anticipates earnings growth of 36.09% in the upcoming year, from $2.66 to $3.62 per share. Although Tesla has not confirmed its next earnings release date, it's estimated to be on Wednesday, April 17th, 2024, based on the previous year's reports.\n\nFrom a fundamental point of view, one might argue that Tesla is overvalued, with a P/E of 46 and a forward P/E of 47. However, from a technical perspective, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 49.15 places it close to oversold territory, making it a prime candidate for a leg up.\n\nSentiment remains mixed for Tesla\n\nDespite possessing a cult-like following and being one of the most searched-for stocks, the sentiment surrounding Tesla remains bearish to mixed.\n\nTesla is among the most downgraded and lowest-rated stocks, according to a list of publicly traded companies that analysts have downgraded most frequently in the past ninety days.\n\nBased on thirty-four analyst ratings, Tesla has a consensus Hold rating. That rating has remained steady over the previous year, during which analysts placing Tesla as a Buy decreased from twenty to the current nine. The analyst’s consensus price target on the stock is $219.89, which forecasts a nearly 10% upside. While the two most recent analyst actions on the stock have not been favorable, both price targets are above the previous close for the stock.\n\nOn February 5, Piper Sandler lowered its target for Tesla from $295 to $225. Daiwa Capital Markets downgraded the stock the following day and reduced its target from $245 to $195.\n\nSupport has been confirmed\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, support has been confirmed in the short term, giving traders and investors a level against which to trade. After pulling into a previous support zone near $180 two weeks ago, the stock found support and buyers and has recently taken out the prior pivot high from earlier in the year. As a result, if the stock can continue to base above previous support and confirm higher lows, a move toward its 200-day Simple Moving Average might be the next target for a leg higher, currently near $233. With a Beta of 2.43, short-term volatility and significant outperformance relative to the market can be expected if a trend develops in Tesla.\n\nBefore you consider Tesla, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis. MarketBeat has identified the five stocks that top analysts are quietly whispering to their clients to buy now before the broader market catches on... and Tesla wasn't on the list.\n\nWhile Tesla currently has a \"Hold\" rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.\n\nView The Five Stocks Here"}

"publisher": {"href": "https://fortune.com", "title": "Fortune"}, "content": "Second time’s the charm—or that’s perhaps what Henrik Fisker thought as he launched the eponymous EV maker Fisker Inc. following a failed attempt a few years earlier (called Fisker Automotive).\n\nNow the critically acclaimed Danish designer’s company is facing a number of high-stakes situations at once.\n\nCalifornia-based Fisker, which listed via a SPAC in 2020, received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange for noncompliance as its stock closed at under $1 on average for 30 trading days consecutively, the company said in a statement last week.\n\nThe notice doesn’t immediately result in Fisker’s trading being suspended on the NYSE—but a failure to comply could eventually lead to delisting.\n\nFisker said it has six months to comply with the stock exchange’s rules once again, and is considering different options, including a reverse stock split, to help with it.\n\n“The company intends to remain listed on the NYSE and is considering all available options to regain compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing standards,” Fisker said in a statement.\n\nFisker’s stock has plummeted nearly 89% in the last year.\n\nThe Ocean SUV maker faced several tailwinds delivering its cars to customers.\n\nLast year, Fisker made just over 10,000 cars, undershooting its initial estimate by over three-quarters and ultimately delivering less than half of the vehicles it manufactured.\n\nTo add to mounting pressures, it became the subject of a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration probe last week after thousands of Fisker’s cars rolled away or moved unprompted in 2023.\n\nCompetition, reach, and more\n\nThe market for EVs has been challenged by greater competition, shrinking cash reserves, and higher costs.\n\nSome of these factors have handicapped many startups in the space, including British company Arrival’s U.K. arm, which entered administration earlier this month (it was delisted from Nasdaq shortly before).\n\nFisker’s Ocean SUV has had a tricky path to chart—whether that’s the initial software issues it faced or, more recently, the review of an influential YouTuber calling it the “worst car” he’s ever tested.\n\nMarques Brownlee, also known as MKBHD, said in a video that driving the Fisker Ocean was his “single weirdest automotive reviewing experience.”\n\nThere were some positives: He praised the car’s design and “comfortable seating.”\n\nFisker has had lofty ambitions about scaling up its EV production to an expected 300 SUVs a day.\n\nBut the company has slipped well below its targets, TechCrunch reported in January citing internal documents.\n\nThe company also delivers SUVs in Europe with the help of its contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Austria, but it has struggled to see its initial estimates of global EV demand reach fruition.\n\nThe company said it would scale down its operations in December to make sure its liquidity stays intact by trimming its production target.\n\nAmong its struggles in the U.S. following Ocean’s launch last June: difficulty with reaching buyers using its direct-to-consumer sales model.\n\nFisker decided to drop the approach, famously adopted by the likes of Tesla and Rivian, to set up traditional dealerships instead in the hopes of growing its presence.\n\nA representative at Fisker directed Fortune to its press release when approached for comment.\n\nBad Karma\n\nHenrik Fisker’s first swing at making cars was through Fisker Automotive, a company that made plug-in hybrid cars and was popular among celebrities including Justin Bieber.\n\nHe was a seasoned expert in the field, having worked at the likes of BMW and Aston Martin.\n\nThe company filed for bankruptcy in 2013 after its flagship vehicle, Karma, failed during its tests.\n\nFisker Automotive had managed to raise $1.4 billion from public and private investors since its founding in 2007, Reuters reported.\n\nDuring its time, the company never made a profit—instead, it lost thousands of dollars on making each car.\n\nWith his second rodeo, Henrik’s big pitch for the EV market has been to make it easier for the masses to afford all-electric cars as the current options can price people out of the market, Henrik told The Verge in an interview last January.\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings released in November, Fisker Inc.’s revenue was $71.8 million, while its losses for the period totaled $91 million."}

As such, we are raising our ratings on Alaska (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU), and Southwest (LUV) from Hold to Buy.” Redburn Atlantic Equities downgrades MSCI to sell from neutral Redburn Atlantic Equities said it sees too many headwinds for the global market services company. “As earnings growth slowed in 2023, MSCI’s underperformance versus peers was notable.

Riley upgraded the marine company after a constructive meeting with company management. “Coming away from our management meetings at MIBS, [Miami International Boat Show] we are upgrading Brunswick Corporation (BC) from Neutral to Buy, while raising our PT from $100 to $108.” Loop downgrades W.W. Grainger to hold from buy Loop said it sees a more balanced risk/reward for the industrial supply company. “We are increasing our price target to $1,000 per share ($925 prior) and would look to get more constructive again if our survey reveals an acceleration in demand, or further upside to GWW’ s share capture initiatives.” Barclays upgrades AvalonBay Communities to overweight from equal weight Barclays said the real estate company has an interesting platform. ” AvalonBay benefits from its unique development platform (2,600 homes expected to deliver in 2024, largely financed by forward equity raises), which helps the company generate relatively solid FFO [funds from operations] growth.” JPMorgan initiates Immunovant to overweight from neutral JPMorgan said the biopharma company has a “compelling profile.” “We initiate coverage on IMVT with an OW rating and a Dec-2024 PT of $51.” Northcoast downgrades Texas Roadhouse to neutral from buy Northcoast downgraded the Texas-theme chain restaurant mainly on valuation. “With a clear path to double-digit revenue growth from mid-to-high single digit unit growth and mid-to-high single-digit SSS, balanced between traffic and pricing/mix, Texas Roadhouse should continue to execute on its playbook to drive system and organic sales growth that supports the firm’s current valuation.” Mizuho upgrades LivaNova to buy from neutral Mizuho said in its upgrade of LivaNova that it likes the med tech company’s incoming CEO. “We see two pivotal paths ahead of the company both of which can lead to asymmetric upside from the current depressed level.” JPMorgan downgrades Holley to neutral from overweight JPMorgan said it’s negative heading into the manufacturing company’s earnings report next week. “We are downgrading HLLY to Neutral from Overweight and lowering our Dec 24 PT to $5; we are also placing HLLY on Negative Catalyst Watch into 4Q23 earnings on Wednesday, February 28th.” Morgan Stanley initiates CG Oncology as buy Morgan Stanley said shares of the bladder cancer company are “compelling.” ” CG Oncology is a late-stage clinical company focused on developing therapies for bladder cancer.” UBS initiates Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund as buy UBS said the financial services company is a defensive. “We initiate coverage on Morgan Stanley Direct Lending with a Buy rating and $23.50 PT.

Tesla, which has led daily stock trading for the last several years, has averaged roughly $22 billion in the same stretch.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven chip maker is coming off eye-watering gains in 2023, and it's off to a stellar start this year with a 47% year-to-date gain.\n\nTesla stock, for its part, has tumbled about 19.5% year-to-date amid a cloudier outlook for electric vehicle demand, Elon Musk's ultimatums to the board for more control, and reports of partying and drug use among Musk and some board members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia will report earnings results for the final three months of 2023 after the closing bell on Wednesday.

Piper Sandler also upgraded US Foods to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $59, up from $45.\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Southwest (LUV) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $42, up from $28. The firm believes more moderate domestic available seat mile growth for 2024 will have positive implications for domestic unit revenue performance, and by extension, should translate into solid sales performance for the domestic-focused names. As such, Deutsche upgraded Alaska (ALK) , JetBlue (JBLU) , and Southwest to Buy from Hold. Meanwhile, Bernstein also upgraded Southwest to Market Perform from Underperform with a price target of $32, up from $26.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\n\n\nArgus downgraded Johnson Controls (JCI) to Hold from Buy. The firm sees the stock's current valuations as reasonable given the company's reduced growth outlook due to the recent cybersecurity attack.\n\nEvercore ISI downgraded Caterpillar (CAT) to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $338, up from $321. The downgrade is not so much company specific as it is a call to take profits on the group, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nPhillip Securities downgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Neutral from Buy with a $150 price target, down from $157. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the recent rally and a slowdown in booking volumes for the downgrade.\n\nPhillip Securities downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Neutral from Accumulate with a $175 price target. The near-term outlook for Tesla \"looks quite bleak, with the company set on sacrificing margins and growth also slowing,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nPhillip Securities downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral from Accumulate with an unchanged price target of $194. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's recent gains, but says it expects Services to continue being Apple's main growth driver as its installed base increases.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\n\n\nSeaport Research initiated coverage of Booking Holdings (BKNG) with a Buy rating and $4,380 price target. The firm is positive on Booking's fundamentals saying the company is the clear leader in global online accommodations, with particular strength in Europe and Asia.\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs initiated coverage of BrightSpring Health (BTSG) with a Buy rating and $26 price target. The firm expects strong growth, emergence of medium-term upside drivers, acquisition execution and de-levering progress to be key drivers of the stock closing the valuation gap relative to peers. Jefferies, Wells Fargo, Leerink, BofA, UBS, and Morgan Stanley also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings, while Deutsche Bank initiated the stock with a Hold.\n\nGoldman Sachs initiated coverage of ArriVent Biopharma (AVBP) with a Buy rating and $27 price target. The firm anticipates clinical success of furmonertinib in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer. Citi and Jefferies also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings.\n\nUBS initiated coverage of Morgan Stanley Direct Lending (MSDL) with a Buy rating and $23.50 price target.

But there are pockets of opportunity in the sector, to say the least.\n\n“We are value investors, and while the automakers are statistically inexpensive, investors face prospects for considerable CAPEX, reduced margins, and an uncertain outcome as it relates to electric vehicle market share,” Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Brian Sponheimer told Yahoo Finance. Sponheimer is focused on the autos and industrials sectors at Gabelli, which is headed by billionaire investor Mario Gabelli.\n\nThat doesn’t mean there won’t be a time to buy automaker stocks such as Ford, GM, and Stellantis; it's just that at the moment, Sponheimer said, they're just too expensive.\n\nSigns are displayed at an AutoNation Chevrolet car dealership on April 21, 2022 in Valencia, Calif. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) (Mario Tama via Getty Images)\n\n“GM [trading] at five times earnings or forward [price to earnings ratio] at six times earnings is expensive,” he said. “[If] the shares are going to take a 20% dip, then that might change just from a trading perspective, but we are really looking for a catalyst in stocks and it's hard to see that right now for the traditional automakers.”\n\nTesla is at the other end of the valuation spectrum. Trading at 200 times earnings or thereabouts, it isn’t the kind of stock that Gabelli’s portfolio managers are going to target, but it could be. For investors, Sponheimer says it needs to have a investable thesis and perhaps a leap of faith.\n\n“Tesla certainly becomes more interesting at these levels than it has been in some time,” he said. “I do think that for a company that is going to be the leader in electric vehicle development over the course of the next decade, there are some really exciting things going on, but I can't definitively say that there's a price that I'm loving diving into, unless I really believe that there is an AI story here that I wanna invest in.”\n\nTraditional automakers and Tesla aside, Sponheimer and Gabelli prefer ancillary trades in the auto space. Areas with more predictable resiliency like car dealership operators are an opportunity, he said, whereas companies like AutoNation (AN) can potentially benefit from increased vehicle complexity to drive parts and service sales.\n\nStory continues\n\n“AutoNation, which still sells through traditional dealerships new vehicles and used, is really taking advantage of what is the profit center of that dealership, to really grow that parts and service business, drive free cash flow, expand the business, and ultimately buy back quite a bit of its own stock in the process,” Sponheimer says.\n\nLooking deeper into the small-cap value trade, slowing EV adoption means opportunity for gas-powered technology providers. New turbocharger technology is in favor across industrial and other various end markets, Sponheimer said, and companies like Garrett Motion (GTX) are poised to prosper.\n\nSponheimer said Garrett, well known among auto enthusiasts for its bolt-on turbochargers, is an “inexpensive stock” given the current environment with “terrific cash flow.”\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

You know, automakers traditionally have been cheap from a statistical standpoint. We're really looking for what the catalysts can be for these stocks over the course of the next five to 10 years. I think you have to look in terms of initially price. And you know, it's hard to it's hard to say that GM at five times earnings or Ford at six times earnings is expensive.\n\nBut the real question as a value investor you have to ask yourself is when do when do you just say it's cheap for a reason? And I think I'm not ready to say that exactly. But I think given the amount of capital investment that needs to come into these industries over the course of the next five years, given the lower margins we're going to see.\n\nStory continues\n\nI mean, Ford to their credit is showing the amount of investment and negative income that comes from the Ford E movement, I think it's difficult as a value investor to really say right now that this is the right time. The shareholder take a 20% dip, that that might change just from a trading perspective. But we are really looking for catalysts in stocks, and it's hard to see that right now for the traditional automakers.\n\n- So should investors be buying the dip, per se, in Tesla at this juncture?\n\nBRIAN SPONHEIMER: Tesla is a really interesting situation. You know, again, we are a value investing community at Gabelli, and you're talking about a company that you really need to have confidence that there is a piece of the Tesla story that goes well beyond traditional automaking.\n\nStock is going to earn somewhere between $3 and $3.50 or $4 for this coming year. And if you're thinking about a stock trading just below $200, what are you going to be paying 45 or 50 times earnings for? Is it for a decelerating top line in a traditional auto business? Is it for the potential down the road for there to be robo taxis? Is it for AI?\n\nSo while Tesla shares have declined over the course of the last year or so, we're not necessarily ready to say that it is a value stock. It's certainly become more interesting at these levels than it has been in some time. And I do think that for a company that is going to be the leader in electric vehicle development over the course of the next decade, there are some really exciting things going on.\n\nBut can't definitively say that there's a price that I'm loving diving to Tesla unless I really believe that there is an AI story here that I want to invest in.\n\n- Yeah. Well, certainly here, when that excitement turns into earnings and realization there is what a lot of investors are going--\n\nBRIAN SPONHEIMER: Two different things.\n\n- Yeah, exactly. Two different things there. Brian Sponheimer, who is the Gabelli Funds portfolio manager and our own Pras Subramanian. Thanks so much for the conversation. Appreciate it.\n\nBRIAN SPONHEIMER: I thank you very much for having me.\n\n- Certainly."}

Some have more than doubled from their bear-market bottoms, with Nvidia up more than sixfold.\n\nThe major driver has been new opportunities for artificial intelligence as the technology shifts from Google’s large language model “Gemini,” to new and advanced cloud-computing capabilities. Investors see more market opportunity for the technology behemoths. Analysts have increased their profit forecasts for the Seven companies, driving the stocks higher.\n\nNow, the group looks too hot—and evidence is building that the Seven is in a bubble that’s starting to burst.\n\nThe first piece of evidence is that the share-price gains are on par with those seen in other bubbles. The “FAANG stocks”—a predecessor group to the Seven—in aggregate, rocketed 229% by 2021 from their lows, before falling 49%, according to Bank of America. Before that, dot-com stocks soared 192% by 2000, and then plunged 73%.\n\nThe next question is when these parties tend to end. Nine out of 14 bubbles that BofA studied burst after less than two years of declines. So far for the Seven, the run has lasted just over a year, so they could falter soon.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nTo that point, so much money has recently rushed into the seven stocks that not much more can move in. Just over a net $10 billion has flown into tech stock funds this so far year alone, putting the inflow on pace to hit $84 billion for the entire year. That would be a record, and about double last year’s $44 billion inflow.\n\nThat might indicate a lack of new buyers of tech stocks in the near future, since everyone interested in the sector has already bought in, and doesn’t need to take any additional risk. Already, tech stocks have retreated from recent peaks, with Nvidia down about 7%. The catalyst has been last week’s higher-than-expected inflation result, which has driven long-dated bond yields upward. Higher long-dated bond yields make future profits less valuable—and investors value these tech companies with the idea that a bulk of their profits will come many years in the future.\n\nSo BofA is calling the AI-hype rally a “baby bubble.”\n\nThat’s a reason not to buy these stocks right now. But one solid strategy is waiting to buy into any massive drop.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nNow for part two—the long-term bull case for the Seven and affiliated tech stocks.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up The Barron's Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers. Preview Subscribed\n\nThe fact is that the AI opportunity is real, and tech earnings are likely to continue growing rapidly for years. Total AI spending can grow at almost 20% annually through 2032 to just over $2.5 trillion by 2032, according to Precedence Research. That would mean similar, or even higher, growth in earnings for companies leading the innovation curve. At some point, their cost increases will moderate, profit margins will stabilize or increase, and these cash-rich firms will buy back stock.\n\nHistory backs up the growth-curve potential. Innovations such as cellphones, the internet, computers, and others grew by a double-digit percentage annually for more than 10 years, according to Trivariate Research.\n\nThat’s why many are looking to “buy it [the group of stocks] for the second leg of success that invariably happens in most technology adoption curves,” wrote Trivariate’s Adam Parker.\n\nFirst a correction, then a long-term bull run for these tech stocks.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue"}

They were responsible for an outsized share of market returns, proving the incredible value of tech to the overall economy. One could even make the argument that their performance prevented a recession.\n\n2024 has mainly started the same for the Magnificent 7, except Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ). It has lost 40% of its value since the beginning of the year. The electric vehicle market is facing multiple issues leading to a free fall. That free fall has prompted many investors to wonder if Tesla continues to deserve its position among the Magnificent 7.\n\nIf that does occur, these three stocks entirely deserve its place.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY)\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY ) Is a clear contender in the conversation about stocks that can unseat Tesla from the Magnificent 7. The Wall Street Journal recently noted that Eli Lilly’s market capitalization exceeded Tesla’s. Today, Eli Lily’s market capitalization is $718 billion, making it the 9th most valuable publicly traded firm globally. Tesla is two places behind Eli Lilly, with a market capitalization of $600 billion.\n\nEli Lilly has been propelled much higher due to FDA approval of Zepbound as a weight loss treatment. The drug shares the same active ingredient with Mounjaro, a diabetes treatment. Analysts believe those two drugs could account for more than $40 billion in annual sales by the decade’s end. Analysts believe those drugs could contribute more than $11 billion in revenues in 2024.\n\nThat suggests that LLY stock has plenty of room to run higher. Additionally, the active ingredient in those leading treatments has potential efficacy in treating other diseases. That suggests an even greater upside, making Eli Lilly a strong contender to supplant Tesla.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet’s do some quick math regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM ) and its stock. Specifically, let’s look at the potential effects of what could happen to its market capitalization in 2024 and what that means.\n\nThe company is bullish about 2024 and anticipates that sales could rise by 20% or more. That’s a powerful signal for the broader semiconductor industry that it serves as the world’s largest foundry. That bullish call means that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has the potential to rise to $160.\n\nAt $160, TSM stock would increase in price by more than 24%, leading to a concurrent market capitalization of 24%. Thus, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s market cap would be roughly $830 billion.\n\nThat would be roughly $100 billion higher than ever valued. By comparison, Tesla was valued at more than $1.2 trillion in late 2021. Both firms exist in volatile Industries, so it’s hard to give either the nudge in that regard. However, Elon Musk is focused on artificial intelligence, and Tesla seems unlikely to pay him what he wants. That opens the door for further trouble at Tesla and gives TSM another chance to slip into the Magnificent 7.\n\nVisa (V)\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE: V ) is an obvious choice to supplant Tesla among the Magnificent 7 stocks. Credit card spending continues to rise, ballooning collective credit card debt. That debt approached $1.13 trillion overall at the end of 2023.\n\nIt makes sense then that Visa Is entering fertile territory moving forward. Visa is already operating exceptionally well. Income and earnings grew nearly 20% during the most recent period. Consumers are addicted to credit and that’s unlikely to change. That has been one of the greatest lessons from the current inflationary period: cash-strapped consumers may feel the pain, but that doesn’t stop them from using credit. Further, more affluent consumers continue to travel abroad at High rates. That has resulted in higher cross-border volumes overall.\n\nThe overall thrust of that narrative is that Visa perhaps deserves Tesla’s spot. If electric vehicles face a prolonged downturn, then a leading consumer stock makes every bit of sense as a replacement. American consumerism is the most important piece of the economy overall. Why isn’t Visa deserving of a spot amongst the Magnificent 7?\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Photo: ... [+] Patrick Pleul/dpa (Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images) dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images\n\nTesla TSLA +0.5% has had a tough 2024 thus far with the stock down nearly 20% since the beginning of the year, compared to the S&P 500 which has gained about 5% over the same period, amid concerns of cooling EV demand, weaker-than-expected Q4 2023 results, and mounting competition. Over Q4, Tesla saw its revenues grow by just about 3.5% year-over-year to $25.2 billion, after several quarters of high growth rates. Tesla’s profitability has also come under pressure, as aggressive price cuts take a toll on Tesla’s margins. The average price of a Tesla vehicle has declined to $44,500 as of Q4, down from over $52,000 in the year-ago quarter. Tesla’s gross margins have declined 610 basis points year-over-year to 17.6% while operating margins almost halved to 8.2%.\n\nCompetition is also mounting and Tesla’s lineup is aging with its Model 3, Y, X, and S remaining the same visually since launch. This is in contrast with mainstream automakers, who typically overhaul vehicle models every six to seven years. China’s BYD surpassed Tesla as the largest EV maker in the world for 2023.\n\nThe near-term outlook looks mixed, as the company warned that 2024 sales growth would be notably lower amid slowing consumer demand and high interest rates which are making it more expensive to finance EV purchases. The company also had to suspend production in Germany for two weeks in late January on account of parts shortages caused by shipping delays via the Red Sea. Tesla also recently carried out new price cuts in China and Europe and this could further weigh on margins.\n\nNow TSLA stock has also seen a decline of 15% from levels of $235 in early January 2021 to around $200 now, vs. an increase of about 35% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the decrease in TSLA stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -65% in 2022, and 102% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that TSLA underperformed the S&P in 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including AMZN, TM, and HD, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could TSLA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?\n\nWe currently remain marginally positive on Tesla stock, with a $210 price estimate, which is about 5% ahead of the market price. We continue to believe that Tesla will remain a big beneficiary of the long-term transition to cleaner transportation and energy generation, given its well-oiled supply chain, superior battery and drive train tech, and its lead with software and self-driving technology. Tesla is also looking to manufacture a mass-market vehicle, which is likely to be a compact crossover starting sometime toward the end of 2025 and this could help drive growth in the long run. In the near term, Tesla could benefit from the recent launch of a mildly refreshed version of its Model 3 and the introduction of its Cybertruck pickup truck. Tesla also began a limited amount of advertising in the second half of 2023 - something that the company has largely avoided since its incorporation.

Adding to its challenges, the company is facing obstacles in expanding its manufacturing plant in Germany. Also, a price war among automakers is intensifying, putting pressure on TSLA’s margins and its share price.\n\nPer a Reuters report, Tesla’s initiative to expand its German manufacturing facility encounters challenges, with citizens voting against clearing the forest for the larger site. Notably, Tesla plans to double the plant’s capacity to 100 gigawatt hours of battery production and 1 million cars per year. This move should strengthen its competitive positioning in the European EV market.\n\nIn other news, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) has announced a reduction in the price of its 2023 Mustang Mach-E, with discounts ranging from $3,100 to a maximum of $8,100. This strategic move by Ford is expected to stimulate sales growth and escalate competition, forcing Tesla and other companies to lower prices at the cost of their margins.\n\nIs Tesla a Buy or Sell Now?\n\nWall Street analysts are sidelined on Tesla stock given the near-term volume and margin headwinds. It has 12 Buy, 17 Hold, and five Sell recommendations for a Hold consensus rating. Analysts’ average price target of $218.75 implies a limited upside potential of 12.9% from current levels.\n\nDisclosure"}

Owners say they noticed orange stains on the stainless steel panels of their nearly new Cybertrucks. However, a Tesla engineer is now saying that your eyes are deceiving you, and Cybertrucks aren’t rusting. Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss.\n\nWes Morrill, the Cybertruck’s lead engineer and director of reliability, test and analysis at Tesla, took to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s social media hellscape that is X (I hate that) to say Cybertrucks are not, in fact, rusting, according to Automotive News. Instead, he asserted that the Cybertruck’s stainless steel body panels are attracting surface contamination that is actually rusting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Stainless steel is reactive and free iron that sits on it will rust,” Morrill wrote. “It’s surface contamination only and can be cleaned off easily.” Musk clearly agreed with Morrill’s February 16 post, because he simply responded “Yeah,” to it. Man, he’s got such a way with words.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorrill’s post was part of a reply to a YouTube video by the Bearded Tesla Guy, according to Automotive News. He called the video “good myth busting” because it showed how the orange specs can be removed from the stainless steel panels with a common household cleaner.\n\nTesla CyberTRUCK or CyberRUST?? The TRUTH About Cybertruck Rusting Issue + How To Fix It!!\n\nThis saga, which has been dubbed “rust-gate,” originated on the Cybertruck Owners Club forum earlier this month when a couple of owners posted images of the small orange specs on their electric pickups. They suggested those specs could be caused by rust or some other form of corrosion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser website GO TO PAGE PLAY Top Stories\n\nHere’s some more information on Bearded Tesla Guy’s February 16 video called “CyberTRUCK or CyberRUST” where he tried different cleaning products to remove the rust contamination, from AutoNews:\n\n\n\nWindow cleaner didn’t work, but a kitchen stainless-steel cleaner did, he said. ”These specks are absolutely everywhere,” Demaree said in the video. “And of course, a rational person would be rather alarmed by this. It’s totally natural if you see this on a new $100,000 truck.” [...] Demaree, with 80,000 YouTube subscribers, speculated the orange stains were likely caused by rail dust that could have contaminated the Cybertruck during transport, or maybe even metal dust from the Tesla factory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven before “rust-gate” Tesla fans online have discussed how hard it has been to keep the exterior panels clean since they don’t have protective clear coats. Tesla itself recommends cleaning any dirt off the truck almost immediately. Who could have known this would be a bad idea? I know the Cybertruck having stainless steel body panels is kind of its schtick, but I feel like a regular body with paint would still get the Tesla fanboys hyped. I don’t know."}

Adjusted earnings are expected at $6.66 billion, up 17.3% on last year and earnings per share of $10.42, up 0.9% year-on-year.\n\nThe large year-on-year jump in revenue is thanks to its “highly-accretive” deal to buy cloud computing leader VMWare for $69 billion, completed last October. Immediately following, the company was exploring headcount reduction possibilities.\n\n“This development was unsurprising, since it followed closely with Hock Tan‘s [CEO] acquisition playbook thus far, with AVGO’s last acquisition in 2018 — CA Technologies for $18.9 billion — resulting in an aggressive headcount reduction by nearly 41% and the sale of the Veracode SaaS platform for $950 million,” said analysts at Seeking Alpha.\n\nTime to Get Long Bitcoin?

The company also said in its most recent quarterly filing that its international manufacturing facilities, including in Germany, allow Tesla “to increase the affordability” of its vehicles for customers in local markets by “reducing transportation and manufacturing costs and eliminating the impact of unfavorable tariffs.”\n\nWhile Tesla has remained a top-selling brand in Europe, it faces competition from more battery electric models than ever in and beyond the region.\n\nSales of new battery electric passenger vehicles in Europe increased 29% year over year in Europe in January, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Germany and France currently represent the two biggest markets for fully electric vehicles in Europe.\n\nTesla’s sales represented 1.7% of the total passenger car market in Europe in January including fully electric, hybrid and internal combustion engine models.\n\nTesla shares are down more than 20% year to date but were trading flat on Wednesday midday at around $193 per share.\n\n\n\nDon’t miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"}

Nvidia Stock Leads Magnificent Seven Among the Magnificent Seven stocks, Nvidia (NVDA) was the top performer, with a scorching 235% year-to-date return through Dec. 15. The AI giant is extended past a new flat base's 505.48 buy point after a Jan. 8 breakout move. Nvidia stock slid 4% Wednesday ahead of the company's earnings report after the close.

In recent weeks, Apple beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter, thanks to iPhone 15 handset sales and services growth. According to MacRumors and other outlets, Apple could have a generative AI feature — internally known as Apple GPT — available on the iPhone and iPad sometime late next year. Meanwhile, Microsoft stock is falling back into buy range above a flat base's 384.30 buy point. The stock dropped 1.1% Wednesday. On Jan. 30, Microsoft beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal second quarter thanks to strong cloud computing business.\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis"}

The Elon Musk-run company continues to whipsaw, and has offered something for both the bulls and bears to work with over the last couple of years.\n\nThe shares lost two-thirds of their value in 2022, which brought a windfall for those who were short on the electric vehicle (EV) giant. However, as has been the case over the longer term, the more persistent short sellers eventually burned their fingers – and a lot of money – as Tesla stock more than doubled in 2023.\n\nThe stock has had a terrible start to 2024, and bears seem to sense an opportunity yet again in what they see as an “overvalued automaker.”\n\nWhy Is Tesla Stock Falling in 2024?\n\nNot much has gone right for Tesla in 2024, ranging from the macro level to the company-specific level, and more importantly, from a leadership level. At the beginning of the year, Tesla reignited the EV price war – this time, through price cuts in China. The price cuts only exacerbated the selling in Chinese EV names like NIO (NIO), Xpeng Motors (XPEV), and Li Auto (LI).\n\nTesla’s Q4 earnings were also poorly received. While investors might have overlooked the slight miss on the bottom line, management's commentary on 2024 deliveries - which it said “may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023” - spooked investors.\n\nI believe a part of Tesla’s rally was driven by the long-term delivery CAGR of 50% that Musk famously touted in early 2021. Now, 2024 could mark the third consecutive year when the company’s deliveries will arrive below - or rather, much below - that level.\n\nWith the Cybertruck still a long way from mass production, and the new low-cost model yet to be announced, Tesla lacks any real short-term growth drivers. The macro environment hasn't been favorable either, with the slowdown in China – Tesla’s biggest overseas market – seeming to worsen by the day. The sentiment toward EV stocks is already quite tepid, as the demand growth is not as strong as most believed it would be.\n\nElon Musk’s Controversies Take a Toll on TSLA Stock\n\nControversies over Musk haven’t helped matters, as the billionaire has threatened to build artificial intelligence (AI) products elsewhere, unless he has more control over Tesla. That goal faces a new roadblock after a Delaware court voided his gigantic $56 billion compensation plan.\n\nWhile reports of Musk using drugs are not new, a Wall Street Journal report says that some Tesla board members also felt pressured to take drugs with Musk, fearing that not doing so would upset the mercurial CEO.\n\nTesla has never been a shining example of corporate governance, which was well exemplified when Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick voided Musk’s compensation package, questioning the board’s independence as well as whether it even negotiated the fat pay package before its approval.\n\nIt isn’t the first time Tesla stock has fallen because of Musk’s actions, as a large part of the stock’s 2022 sell-off could be attributed to his antics surrounding his Twitter (now X) acquisition.\n\nTesla Stock Forecast: Analysts Get Apprehensive\n\nA section of the market, which includes long-standing bulls like Cathie Wood, continues to be bullish on Tesla, and her ARK Invest believes that Tesla’s target market will rise multi-fold with the launch of the low-cost model. Then we have the bearish camp, which continues to dislike Tesla, even irrespective of any positive developments.\n\nHowever, the recent events have made even some former bulls apprehensive about Tesla. Daiwa downgraded the shares from “outperform” to “neutral,” citing the lax corporate governance among other factors. Ross Gerber, a key Tesla shareholder, also believes that Musk's behavior is taking a toll on the stock.\n\nPiper Sandler, which continues to be “overweight” on Tesla, lowered its target price by $70 to $225. Even Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster, who is far from being a Tesla bear, also sounded cautious after the company’s disappointing 2024 outlook.\n\nTesla now has a consensus rating of “Hold” from analysts, which is a markdown from the average “Moderate Buy” rating a month back. The stock’s mean target price of $221.31 is almost 20% higher than yesterday’s close.\n\nCan TSLA Stock Recover in 2024?\n\nTesla shares have gone through even worse turmoil previously, but have eventually recovered. That said, the company faces several uncertainties and unknowns in the near term, which makes the short-term outlook quite hazy.\n\nThat said, for those who believe in Musk and the Tesla story, the dip could be an opportunity to double down on those bets, as it still remains one of the most consequential companies of our times, with a presence in multiple exciting industries like electric cars, renewable energy, autonomous driving, robotics, and supercomputers.\n\nFor bears, perhaps no price would be a bargain for buying Tesla shares, as it has and might continue to trade at premium valuations when benchmarked against legacy automakers.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: NIO , XPEV , LI .

Wall Street was looking for 73 cents. What’s more, Tesla management said automotive sales growth in 2024 would be substantially below 2023.\n\nThey weren’t more specific than that. Vehicle sales grew almost 40% year over year in 2023, hitting 1.8 million units. Wall Street expects 2.1 million to 2.2 million units for 2024, up about 20%. That growth rate is below the 40% rate of 2023, but analysts would have felt better if Tesla guided to a firm number.\n\nNow analysts have weighed in after digesting the fourth quarter report and vague volume guidance for 2024—and they aren’t impressed.\n\n“We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure, and fluctuating demand,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Thursday report. “Instead we got a high-level Tesla long-term view with another train wreck conference call.”\n\nThe “train wreck” had Tesla stock down 12% to $182.63 on Thursday, its worst days since Jan. 3, 2023. The S&P 500 gained 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.2%.\n\nIves still rates Tesla shares Buy, but he cut his price target to $315 from $350 a share. RBC analyst Tom Narayan rates shares Buy too, but cut his target price a more modest $3, to $297 from $300 a share after the Tesla earnings call.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\n“We leave our delivery estimates unchanged after the vague guide, but lower our car gross margin expectations on less robust cost down opportunity,” wrote the analyst in a Wednesday evening report, adding that Tesla’s next-generation vehicle platform—a lower price Tesla EV—is “many quarters away” from impacting numbers.\n\n“With recent price cut, margins likely fall in 2024,” wrote Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan in a Wednesday evening report.\n\nTesla’s automotive gross profit margins, excluding regulatory credit sales, came in at about 17.1% in the fourth quarter, up from 16.3% in the third quarter of 2023. Analysts, coming into the earnings report, were forecasting margins of almost 18% for 2024. Those estimates are at risk now.\n\nLangan rates shares Hold and cut his target price to $200 a share from $223.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThere have been at least seven price target cuts from Wall Street analysts following the conference call. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi didn’t cut his price target though. He rates shares Sell and kept his $150 price target for Tesla stock. Sacconaghi wrote that 2024 will be a challenging year and it’s “increasingly apparent that 2025 will likely not be better.”\n\nTesla management seems to agree with him about 2024. Tesla bulls hope he is wrong about 2025.\n\nAfter all the cuts, the average analyst target price for Tesla stock is down to about $226, about $12 lower than the pre-call level, according to FactSet.\n\nComing into Thursday trading, Tesla stock was off about 16% year to date. More price cuts and weakening EV demand have weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nWrite to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com External link"}

With a market cap now topping $1.7 trillion, Nvidia ranks as the third most valuable U.S. firm behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nHowever, these towering valuations are surrounded by assumptions from impulse traders who want to make quick gains from the stock increase.\n\nThis can be seen when Nvidia stock dropped 5% on Tuesday amid pre-earnings jitters. The impending risk of a growth setback shows why Nvidia’s next quarterly update is so crucial.\n\nAlongside Nvidia, other AI-related equities like Super Micro Computer have attracted frenzied trading, especially among retail investors and algorithms chasing momentum over fundamentals.\n\nOn Tuesday alone, activity from Nvidia and Super Micro constituted 46% of total dollar volume for the 10 most-traded U.S. stocks. As such, Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, drew dot-com comparisons, questioning whether recent price spikes reflect AI firms’ intrinsic worth.\n\nNotably, Nvidia controls roughly 80% of high-performance AI chips, providing it with unmatched influence in determining the trajectory of artificial intelligence adoption.\n\nWith segments like data centers, autonomous vehicles, and cloud services increasingly integrating AI, Nvidia quarterly updates offer vital guidance on growth expectations.\n\nAny weakening of demand would reverberate across tech, especially with speculative bets amplifying AI stock upside/downside.\n\nEarnings Pose Moment of Truth for AI Euphoria\n\nDespite these headwinds, demand for Nvidia’s graphics chips continues to outstrip supply as data centers undergo severe AI upgrades. VanEck portfolio manager Angus Shillington said, “There’s an understanding that China is going to go its way” regarding domestically-produced chips.\n\nHis firm’s semiconductor ETF has over $150 million in Nvidia holdings. China represents 20% of Nvidia’s total revenue. Given Nvidia’s AI primacy and the exuberance surrounding its valuation, Wednesday’s earnings release marks a moment of truth for sentiment.\n\nTo avoid a selloff, Nvidia would have to deliver exceptionally strong results and future guidance, reaffirming the narrative of boundless AI expansion.\n\nWith Tesla shares sliding 23% amid demand issues for its electric cars, Nvidia now singularly guides assumptions around tech’s next transformational wave.\n\nAny cracks in its armor could undermine the premises underlying 2024’s speculative run-up. All eyes rest on Nvidia, with AI seemingly at an inflection point.\n\nIf adoption truly approaches exponential curves, Nvidia’s upside remains vast. But with expectations so intertwined with AI promise, disappointment could puncture optimistic projections."}

After a euphoric multi-year run-up, AMD, Nvidia (NVDA), and SMCI’s direction will decide where Nasdaq (QQQ) ends up next.\n\nNvidia reports results tomorrow after markets close. 38 analysts raised their EPS revisions in the last 90 days. Not one analyst lowered it. The EPS GAAP estimate for Nvidia is $4.22 on revenue of $20.55 billion. AMD, which is behind Nvidia technologically on PC graphics cards and AI server systems, will follow NVDA’s stock direction.\n\nEV Stocks Fall\n\nOn Sunday, Albemarle (ALB), a top lithium producer, slashed 203 demand, citing slower EV adoption. The miner said that the shift to EVs in the U.S. and Europe is slower than management expected. This is not new information, since lithium carbonate prices fell to a three-year low at the time of writing.\n\nTesla (TSLA) slashed prices to respond to the weak demand. In China, Tesla auto registrations from Feb. 5 – 18 were only 8,200 vehicles. Li Auto sold 7,000 units, far more than Nio (1,500 units) and Xpeng (XPEV) at 1,000 units.\n\nLucid (LCID) slashed prices of its EV recently as did Fisker (FSR). Consider avoiding all EV stocks for now.\n\n"}

The 400% surge over the past year means that Nvidia is now worth just as much as the entire Chinese stock market.\n\n\"If AI is the next industrial revolution, then absolutely we could see Nvidia's valuation surge continuing,\" Kathleen Brooks of the online broker XTB told BI in an interview last week.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"}

Despite the stock being down almost 20% so far this year, it entered trade on February 19 with a market cap of $637 billion. This is the starting point for my TSLA stock analysis.\n\nThat’s more than twice the value of Toyota Motor (NYSE: TM ), which sits in second at $306 billion. The second most valuable U.S. car company, Ford Motor (NYSE: F ), is worth $55 billion.\n\nBut how big is Tesla, really? Tesla sales last year came to $96 billion. Toyota had $247 billion. Ford had $176 billion. Tesla saw nearly $15 billion in net income, but Toyota had over $16 billion. (Ford had just $4 billion.)\n\nThe question for today is, without Elon Musk, would Tesla still be worth a premium?\n\nTesla Strengths\n\nTesla earned its advantage over Toyota, and the rest of the industry, by building out the infrastructure for EV production and making it profitable.\n\nBut profitability is stalling. Auto revenue was no better in the fourth quarter, at $21 billion, than the year before. Services, including charges for the software running in Tesla cars, saved the quarter, adding 10% to total revenue.\n\nThis is the argument Tesla fans have always made, that it’s less a product company like Toyota and more a services business like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Services at Apple represent just 19% of revenue.\n\nTesla fans also love its battery business, which was worth $6 billion last year. Tesla has a huge battery plant in Nevada, but the Inflation Reduction Act means competitors are building their own plants. Tesla is also assembling batteries made by Chinese giant CATL, which is building a plant in Michigan for Ford. CATL is worth an estimated $100 billion.\n\nIt seems Tesla’s strengths are weakening.\n\nTesla Weaknesses\n\nTesla’s weaknesses are also strengthening.\n\nThe biggest weakness is its product line, which needs a complete refresh. The cars all look like Toyota’s Camry. The Camry will soon be hybrid-only, a power system American buyers prefer because the gas engine eliminates range anxiety.\n\nThis is where the market battle will be fought, with Toyota believing full electrics will never get more than 30% of the global market, due to lagging infrastructure.\n\nFord and General Motors (NYSE: GM ) agree with Toyota. Today’s batteries are too heavy for the huge pick-ups on which American companies make their money. This is a key part of my TSLA stock analysis.\n\nToyota is the big threat, which is why its stock is up 59% over the last year, against a 4% loss for Tesla. Tesla’s supply chain is all-electric. The value of Toyota’s $198 billion in property, against Tesla’s $60 billion, might be discounted. By how much?\n\nThen there’s the Tesla Cybertruck, which looks like a giant failure. Meanwhile, Toyota is rolling out an electric version of its Tacoma truck, Ford and GM are building hybrids, and sales of the Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN ) electric are slowing.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI can see why Tesla is still the most valuable American car company. But 13 times more? I can also see why Tesla would be worth what Toyota is. But twice as much?\n\nThe difference between Toyota’s valuation and Tesla’s is Elon Musk. Musk isn’t worth $330 billion to me.\n\nToyota will be facing the same competitors two years from now that it’s facing today. Tesla, with its all-electric line-up, will also be facing BYD (OTCMKTS: BYDDF ) and a host of other Chinese names.\n\nThe name of the EV game in 2025 will be producing a $25,000 car. That’s a price a middle-income family can afford. That’s what I paid for my current car. Toyota meets it, with its hybrids. BYD will meet it, with electrics.\n\nTesla won’t meet it. Sell it.

(which trades under the symbol TSLA) is a car company, but if you want to buy Tesla stock, it helps to be comfortable with roller coasters.\n\nThat’s because wild up-and-down share price swings are a hallmark of the stock’s performance, especially given the company's mercurial CEO, Elon Musk, and his constant presence in the news, particularly since purchasing Twitter (now known as \"X\"). But maybe the opportunity to buy Tesla stock during one of its price dips is what piques your interest.\n\nHow to buy Tesla stock\n\nYou can buy Tesla stock through a brokerage account. You have to add money to the account and then purchase purchase Tesla stock shares from there. You cannot buy Tesla stock directly from Tesla the company.\n\n» Check out the best brokerage accounts for stock trading\n\nAdvertisement Charles Schwab Interactive Brokers IBKR Lite Webull NerdWallet's ratings are determined by our editorial team.

Learn More Learn More Learn More\n\n1. Make sure you have a brokerage account\n\nIf you don’t already have an investment account, you’ll need one to buy Tesla stock. In general, you’ll want a brokerage account with no trading commissions, useful trading tools and no account or inactivity fees.\n\nWorth noting: If you’re buying Tesla shares for retirement because you believe in the company’s long-term potential, a Roth IRA could be a good parking spot. That’s because qualified withdrawals from a Roth are tax-free, so you won’t be responsible for paying Uncle Sam for investment gains (like with a traditional IRA), which could be substantial with a potentially fast-growing company like Tesla.\n\nIf this is all new to you, here is what you’ll need to know to open a brokerage account.\n\n2. Research Tesla's fundamentals\n\nBefore you load up the trunk with Tesla shares, pop open the hood and see what you’re really getting into. Remember, when you buy a stock, you’re purchasing a small portion of an actual business, not just hitching a ride on a cult of personality.\n\nTesla's balance sheet, income statement, competition and management (all explained in our guide on how to research stocks) will help you give the company a good once-over.\n\nYou can access research, analyst ratings and other key information about Tesla via your brokerage account or a financial information website. If you like what you see, your next step is to consider the rest of your portfolio.\n\n3. Decide whether you should buy Tesla stock\n\nOne of the key tenets of investing is diversification, which means spreading your money around among many different investments — a variety of companies, industries and geographical locations, as well as investments that aren't tied to the stock market, like bonds or real estate. This is the “don’t put all of your eggs in one basket” rule you may have heard.\n\nIf you don’t have a diversified portfolio yet, one of the easiest ways to get there is by investing in mutual or index funds rather than individual stocks. Funds essentially bundle stocks together to lessen the chances that you’ll lose your entire investment if a single company tanks. (Here’s how to invest in index funds, many of which, conveniently enough, contain Tesla stock.)\n\nIf you do already have a diversified portfolio, you'll want to consider how Tesla fits into that — ask yourself how much you're already exposed to EV stocks, or simply to stocks in general. A strong portfolio has a healthy mix of stocks and bonds, though the exact asset allocation depends on your goals, timeline and risk tolerance.\n\n4. Set a budget for your Tesla stock purchase\n\nThis is partially dictated by how much money you have to invest. But you should also think about how much of your portfolio you want to tie to Tesla’s business performance, and where you stand in your progress toward other financial goals.\n\nHigh on most lists should be an emergency fund. Experts suggest aiming for three-to-six months' worth of expenses, though even $500 to $1,000 is a good start. Your emergency fund should go not into an individual stock like Tesla, but into a high-yield savings account where it is safe and accessible.\n\nIt's wise to also consider when you'll need the money you plan to invest in Tesla — generally speaking, stock market investments should have a time frame of five years or more, meaning you should be thinking of Tesla as a long-term investment, and only investing money you won't need in the near future.\n\nFinally, there's your budget. What if you don’t have enough to buy an entire share of Tesla? You may be able to purchase a fractional share — essentially a piece of a share. Several brokers now offer fractional shares of individual stocks.\n\nTrack your finances all in one place. Find ways to save more by tracking your income and net worth on NerdWallet. Sign Up\n\n5. Decide when to buy Tesla stock\n\nWhen a company’s share price is somewhat unpredictable, it can be hard to know when to step on the gas and go forward with purchasing shares. The good news is that you have options. They are:\n\nBuy Tesla stock right now: When you're ready to buy Tesla stock in your brokerage account, you'll be given the option to choose between a market order and a limit order. A market order places the trade right away. It will be executed at the best possible price at the time of your trade. The potential downside is that with a fast-moving stock like Tesla, by the time your order goes through, you could end up paying more (or less!) than what you were quoted.\n\nBuy Tesla stock at a specific share price: A limit order allows you to set the price you’re willing to pay and only takes place if the stock reaches that price or lower. It’s a good way to ensure some predictability in what you pay. A possible downside: Your order may not be fully executed, or even fulfilled at all, if Tesla’s price swings so wildly that enough shares don’t become available before the order expires.\n\nBuy Tesla stock systematically over time: Dollar-cost averaging takes some of the fear and guesswork out of deciding the best time to buy Tesla stock. Instead of buying all the shares you want in a single purchase, you spread out your trades and buy shares at regular intervals over time (days, months and even years). You can schedule these purchases based on price with a stop-loss or stop-limit order, as explained in more depth in our full guide to how to buy stocks."}

Here's what you need to know.\n\n\n\nWhat's going on\n\nAs noted above, Wood and her team have purchased over $160 million worth of Tesla stock since the start of the year. Wood's flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK), now owns about $640 million of Tesla stock, making the company the fund's second-largest holding behind Coinbase.\n\nTicker Company Name Market Value (in millions) Weight COIN Coinbase Global $628.1 8.11% TSLA Tesla $626.7 8.09% ROKU Roku $625.1 8.07% PATH UiPath $490.1 6.33% SQ Block $489.6 6.32%\n\nData from ARK-funds.com as of Feb 7, 2024.\n\nARK Invest remains bullish that Elon Musk and the rest of Tesla's management team will find a way out of the predicament they've found themselves in following a disappointing fourth-quarter earnings report and weak guidance.\n\nTo recap, Tesla's gross margins continue to crater, reducing its appeal over rival automakers.\n\nTSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFurthermore, the company issued lackluster guidance for vehicle volume growth in 2024, blaming the ramp-up to its next-generation model, which is due in 2025.\n\nAt any rate, Wood's massive bet on Tesla shows that she believes brighter days are ahead for the company. But what's her exact thesis?\n\nWood's Tesla thesis, valuation, and Elon Musk\n\nIn short, Wood and her team are taking the long view on Tesla. ARK Invest has a price target of $2,000 on the stock owing to its ability to perfect and monetize its full self-driving (FSD) software. Moreover, Wood believes the company can parlay its FSD breakthroughs into a fleet of robotaxis that could revolutionize transportation, allowing society to rethink how people and cargo move from place to place.\n\nIn any event, Wood is placing a big bet on a company with an expensive valuation. Tesla's shares trade with a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 43, despite the recent sell-off.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSLA PE Ratio Chart\n\nGiven its valuation, Tesla is not a stock for value investors or those who are income-oriented. Rather, it's a stock for growth investors with a long time horizon.\n\nHowever, for those inclined to that investing style, the current dip in Tesla shares may offer an opportunity, one that Wood has already pounced on in the past several weeks. If Musk has proven one thing on his way to becoming the world's richest person, it's that he knows how to rally when the chips are down.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

CEO Elon Musk said the company was between two major growth waves, indicating that investors would have to be patient until new products help reaccelerate Tesla's growth rate.\n\nTesla's automotive revenue growth slowed to just 1% year over year, reaching $21.6 billion, and overall revenue grew just 3% to $25.2 billion. Additionally, profits continued to tumble, with gross margin slipping from 23.8% in the quarter a year ago to 17.6% in Q4 2023, and operating income fell 47% to $2.06 billion.\n\nWhile Tesla's growth has moderated significantly, the stock still retains a significant premium over other automakers. This is primarily due to expectations of coming disruptive technologies like full self-driving, its Optimus autonomous humanoid robot, and new car models, including a lower-priced offering and even \"robotaxi,\" a purely autonomous vehicle without a steering wheel.\n\nMusk made predictions about two of those initiatives, and either could be game changers for Tesla. Here's what he had to say.\n\nImage source: Tesla.\n\n1. Full self-driving could be coming this year\n\nFull self-driving has become something of a white whale for Tesla, as the company has been touting the technology for years, but it has yet to be fully deployed, though a beta version is available.\n\nFor many investors, full self-driving, or FSD, is the technology that will make Tesla a truly transformative company. Ark Invest's Cathie Wood envisions robotaxis with FSD technology contributing a majority of the company's profits as soon as 2030, just six years away.\n\nIt's unclear when Tesla will offer full self-driving, as there are technological, reputational, and regulatory hurdles. However, according to Musk's comments on the earnings call, it could be coming sooner than most investors think.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn response to a question about other carmakers licensing FSD technology, Musk said, \"I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses. We've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet. I think that will become obvious probably this year.\"\n\nIt's not clear exactly what Musk is referring to when he says \"obvious,\" but it sounds like the company is on the verge of making it clear that FSD is real and functional. He also said he was interested in hosting another AI day later this year, so investors should expect to learn more about the timeline for FSD, and could even see a release sometime in 2024.\n\n2. Tesla's next-gen vehicle is coming in 2025\n\nTesla has also been teasing a mass-market vehicle for years as well, and investors finally got some information regarding that launch.\n\nIn response to a question about moving production of the next-generation vehicle platform to Austin, Texas, Musk said, \"Our current schedule says that we will start production toward the end of 2025, so sometime in the second half. That's just what our current schedule says.\" Musk also acknowledged that he's \"often optimistic regarding time,\" a tongue-in-cheek reference to his earlier delivery promises that came up short. For example, the Cybertruck was originally slated for delivery in 2021, but it finally rolled out late last year.\n\nMusk has said time and again that competing on price is key to the company's long-term growth and market share gains, and introducing a mass-market vehicle that could be priced around $25,000 is a cornerstone of that strategy. The Tesla chief also added, \"We're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle,\" and he called the manufacturing system involved \"revolutionary.\"\n\nAn affordable Tesla vehicle that could compete with the likes of a Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic could be a game changer for the company, especially if it performs significantly better than similarly priced vehicles.\n\nWhat it means to Tesla investors\n\nTesla did not give guidance for 2024, but it seems likely to be a lost year for the company, barring a major announcement with full self-driving. Still, the stock's recent pullback seems to adequately reflect the business's near-term weakness.\n\nIf the company can deliver on FSD and the next-gen vehicle, the stock should be a winner over the long term. Of course, Musk's comments on the timeline aren't a guarantee by any means, but the potential of another disruption from Tesla should help put a floor on the EV stock, barring further declines in its profit margins or negative revenue growth.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Bloomberg News was the first to report these price changes.\n\nTesla’s price cuts in the region began in late 2022 and early last year, roiling the industry and leading China’s other automakers to cut prices in order to compete.\n\nTesla’s new price cuts come as competition continues to heat up on the mainland, with rivals like NIO and BYD announcing new models. BYD has also gone more upmarket, pushing into segments where Tesla has operated and found success. Sliding margins due to price cuts around the globe have dimmed investor sentiment on Tesla stock in recent weeks.\n\nThough BYD sells more vehicles than Tesla in China, Tesla did have a strong December, with sales jumping nearly 69% in December to 94,139 units, according to the China Passenger Car Association. BYD, which sells hybrids and pure EVs, sold 341,043 cars in China in December, up 45% from a year ago.\n\nTesla's new Model 3 sedan is displayed at the China International Fair for Trade in Services in Beijing, China Sept. 2, 2023. (Florence Lo/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nGiga Berlin idled due to Red Sea attacks\n\nAs first reported by Reuters, Tesla announced it would suspend most production at its Giga Berlin plant in Germany due to a lack of components and parts coming from suppliers using the Red Sea transport routes.\n\n\"The attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants, in solidarity with Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in its fight against Israel in Gaza, have disrupted one of the world's most important shipping routes but US electric vehicle maker Tesla is the first company to disclose a resulting interruption to output,\" Reuters reported on Thursday.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe US and its allies struck back at the Houthis early Friday morning with missile strikes on Houthi targets inside Yemen in retaliation for attacks on commercial tanker ships.\n\nTesla's Giga Berlin exclusively builds the Model Y SUV for European and other select markets.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Tesla said supplier components coming from Asia will have to shift routes from the Red Sea and Suez Canal to around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, leading to longer lead times and \"gaps in supply chains.\"\n\nTesla production stands still at the Berlin Gigafactory in Gruenheide, Germany, because of the armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia. (Patrick Pleul/Pool via AP, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSwedish automaker Volvo also said on Friday it would be halting some production at a plant in Belgium due to delays in getting gearboxes from suppliers forced to use longer shipping routes.\n\nThough Tesla's Giga Berlin isn't as productive as its plants in Shanghai and Fremont, Calif., it did reach 5,000 Model Ys produced in a week in May of last year, meaning around 10,000 vehicles or so could be affected. According to Tesla, Giga Berlin has an installed annual capacity of 375,000 vehicles, whereas Giga Shanghai sits at over 950,000 units.\n\nThe next big test for Tesla and its shareholders will be coming in less than two weeks, when the automaker reports fourth quarter earnings results after the bell on Wednesday, Jan. 24.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The agreements included a 25% increase in wages.\n\nFollowing the deal between the UAW and the Big Three, the union launched a campaign to organize non-union workers at other automakers, including Tesla.\n\nSince then, some automakers increased employees' wages, which could stave off union organization action. Hyundai said that it would start raising pay for workers in 2024 so that hourly wages would increase by 25% by 2028.2 Volkswagen also offered an 11% raise to some of its production workers.3\n\nTesla itself reportedly announced plans to raise the hourly pay for some workers at its Nevada battery factory by 10% or more starting in January.\n\nThe pressure for the EV maker to unionize extends beyond the U.S. as workers in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway went on strike in late 2023.\n\nThe unions face an uphill battle in organizing Tesla workers especially as the company's chief executive officer, Elon Musk, has been vocal in his firm anti-union stance.4\n\n\n\nTesla shares were down 3.4% in early afternoon trading Thursday.

In 2023, weakening demand led to a series of price reductions, effectively increasing sales volumes but adversely affecting profit margins.\n\nMoreover, in the shape of Chinese EV maker BYD, the company has encountered a genuine contender (certainly in China) in the race for EV supremacy.\n\nThat said, despite these and other issues, Mizuho’s Vijay Rakesh, a 5-star analyst rated in the top 1% of the Street’s stock pros, thinks Tesla is set to keep its EV crown for a while.\n\n“While there are multiple concerns with competitor ramps, particularly in China with BYD, China/US price cuts, and potential EV slowdown in the US, we continue to see BEV as the powertrain of the future and believe that over the long-term TSLA’s significant head start in EV manufacturing, vertically-integrated manufacturing process and technology leadership could help keep Tesla at the forefront of EV ramps as electrification is adopted globally,” Rakesh opined.\n\nFurthermore, Rakesh counts Tesla’s improving battery tech, strong ADAS/AD roadmap, the potential of the Cybertruck (even though he concedes its opportunities will be “more muted near-term”) plus the possibility of a low-cost Model 2 coming to market in 2025E/26E, as other reasons why the company will keep its status as a leader in the global EV market.\n\nIt also helps that, aside from BYD in China, most competitors simply don’t have the scale and volume required to produce profitable EVs. Rakesh reckons Tesla will reach deliveries of ~2.3 million vehicles in 2024E, amounting to a ~25% year-over-year increase, while maintaining “good” OMs (operating margins, which currently stands at ~10%), even in the face of the recent price cuts.\n\nThere are risks involved, however, the biggest being a “significant slowdown of EV demand, forcing Tesla to further cut prices, impacting revenue and margin.”\n\nStill, that is not enough to dampen Rakesh’s bullish outlook with the analyst giving TSLA shares a Buy rating and a $310 price target. Investors stand to pocket ~32% gain should the analyst’s thesis play out. (To watch Rakesh’s track record, click here)\n\nTesla almost always elicits a wide variety of takes amongst Street analysts and that is also the case right now. Ultimately, the stock claims a Hold consensus rating based on a mix of 12 Buys, 13 Holds and 5 Sells. At $249.92, the average target suggests the shares have room for only modest growth of 6% in the year ahead.

The company's ongoing challenges were laid bare in its fourth-quarter earnings call, where management outlined a bleak outlook for growth and margins amid rising competition from low-cost Chinese rivals like BYD.\n\nBut while Tesla's near-term prospects are grim, what does the future hold? Let's discuss some trends that could evolve over the next decade and possibly make or break the company.\n\nCan Tesla's automotive business be saved?\n\nOver the next ten years, Tesla's success will depend on protecting its market share from a growing list of Chinese rivals. BYD is likely the biggest threat because of its high level of vertical integration. The Chinese rival not only manufactures its batteries, but also owns stakes in lithium mines to ensure a steady supply of low-cost raw materials.\n\nAccording to Reuters, a battery accounts for around 40% of a new electric vehicle's (EV) price. And over the coming years, Tesla will need to pay serious attention to this side of the industry if it wants to stay competitive.\n\nIn May, the company broke ground on its first in-house lithium refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The over $1 billion project could help expand the company's access to battery-grade lithium.\n\nElon Musk calls lithium refining a 'license to print money' (although this will probably depend on supply and demand). And he expects the new facility to produce enough battery-grade lithium for 1 million EVs by 2025. For context, Tesla produced 1.85 million cars in 2023, so this project could bring substantial virtual integration to the company.\n\nConsider the other growth drivers\n\nWhile investors must wait for Tesla's automotive business to possibly regain its mojo, the company has several other growth drivers that could rise in importance over the next decade. These include self-driving cars, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that experts at Boston Consulting believe could become widespread by 2035.\n\nStory continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nTesla is investing in this opportunity through a new supercomputer called Dojo, which will analyze the data generated from thousands of Tesla vehicles on the road with its self-driving software installed.\n\nOver time, these \"full-self-driving\" (FSD) installations (which cost $12,000 plus a $99 monthly subscription) could become a major source of revenue for Tesla, and possibly be licensed to other automakers. Expanding into AI software could also help create an economic moat around Tesla's business and prevent it from getting trapped in a race to the bottom with BYD and other low-cost Chinese automakers.\n\nInvestors should remember, however, that the AI thesis could take over a decade to play out. And Tesla isn't the only company working on self-driving and other autonomous mobility solutions.\n\nTesla stock is a hold\n\nWhile Tesla is a resilient company with a track record of overcoming challenges, it is unclear if its vertical integration efforts and other growth drivers will be enough to maintain the explosive stock price growth investors have become used to. And with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 57, shares are quite expensive considering the challenges ahead. Tesla stock looks like a hold until more information becomes available.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Its shares were up about 15% in early trading.\n\nBetter-than-expected isn’t the word investors will use to describe results posted Wednesday evening at Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group LCID -1.95% . Rivian management said they expect to make 57,000 vehicles in 2024, up from about 50,000 in 2023, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 66,000. Lucid expects to make about 9,000 vehicles in 2024, up from the roughly 6,000 it sold in 2023 but far below the 12,000 Wall Street had expected.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up The Barron's Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers. Preview Subscribed\n\nLucid stock was down 19% in morning trading, while Rivian shares fell almost 27%.\n\nThe weaker-than-expected results caught the attention of Tesla TSLA -2.76% CEO Elon Musk. He said Wednesday night in response to a question on the social-media platform X that the “current trajectory has [Rivian] bankrupt in about six quarters. Maybe that trajectory will change, but so far it hasn’t.” He included a chart of Rivian’s falling cash balance.\n\nRivian isn’t profitable yet. It ended the year with almost $10 billion in cash and investments on its books. Management has said that is enough for the company to fund itself through 2025; the company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGary Black, co-founder of the Future Fund Active ETF External link , which has invested in Tesla, said he was confused as to why Musk would be commenting on the competition at all. Rivian’s problems aren’t necessarily good for Tesla, he said, even if they could eventually remove a competitor.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\n“Further near-term demand or pricing pressures [could] limit Tesla upside,” he said.\n\nLoading tweet...\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the tweet.\n\nTesla, of course, is profitable and generates free cash flow. That is one reason its shares are riding out the effects of Rivian’s and Lucid’s results.\n\nAnother reason Tesla stock is outperforming its peers in Thursday trading boils down to pricing. The average price for a Lucid vehicle—taking sales and dividing by units sold—worked out to about $91,000 in the fourth quarter. The average price for a Rivian vehicle was $94,000, while Tesla’s average price for the fourth quarter was about $44,000. It is the only one of the three that makes relatively affordable EVs.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nWhat is more, the market for high-end EVs is saturated in the U.S. All-battery EVs from luxury brands, including Tesla, accounted for some 40% of total U.S. luxury-vehicle sales this past year.\n\nBattery-electric penetration of nonluxury cars amounted to roughly 2% of new car sales in 2023.

While startup EV stocks Rivian RIVN and Lucid LCID are selling off hard in the early going after their latest quarterly reports, AI chip giant Nvidia NVDA continues to defy gravity after its highly anticipated Q4 results, with the shares leading today's rally on Wall Street.\n\nSitting out today's upside is EV giant Tesla TSLA, whose market cap now stands at $620.3 billion - down from a peak north of $1 trillion at its highs. Today's remarkably lopsided earnings reactions could add fuel to the fire for those who argue that TSLA should be booted from the elite group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven,\" which also includes Nvidia, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, Meta META, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nWhile it's an informal title, the Magnificent Seven moniker isn't just window dressing. These companies collectively added a staggering $5.1 trillion in total market cap during 2023, and the universe of all U.S.-listed stocks would have advanced by just 12.6% last year without the Magnificent Seven's influence, compared to 23.3% with their returns included.\n\nThat's why debates are starting to flare about Tesla's inclusion in the group, as the Elon Musk-led company has been pressured by a litany of troubles since the start of the year. With Tesla stock now down 22.6% on a YTD basis, here's a look at three mega-cap stocks worthy of replacing the EV maker in the Magnificent Seven.\n\n1. Broadcom Stock\n\nFounded in 1961 and based out of Palo Alto, Calif., Broadcom AVGO is a global leader in infrastructure technology, providing a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions for data centers, cloud computing, networking, and wireless communications. It currently commands a massive market cap of $574.2 billion.\n\nAVGO stock is up 15.4% on a YTD basis. Moreover, the stock offers a dividend yield of 1.71%, backed by 13 years of growth. Barchart\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings report, Broadcom beat Wall Street's expectations on both the top line and bottom line. Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.3 billion, up 4% from the previous year. Adjusted EPS improved 6% to $11.06, surpassing the consensus estimate of $10.96. Notably, the company's EPS has topped expectations in each of the past five quarters.\n\nFurther, Broadcom is expected to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the booming AI market. It's the second-largest AI chip company by revenue, behind only Nvidia - powered by heavy demand from partners like Google. Plus, its recent acquisition of VMware should bolster AVGO's cloud credentials.\n\nAnalysts have an average rating of “Strong Buy” for AVGO stock, which is already trading above its mean price target of $1,171.43. However, the Street-high target price of $1,550 indicates an upside potential of about 20% from current levels.\n\nOut of 25 analysts covering the stock, 21 have a “Strong Buy” rating and 4 have a “Hold” rating. Barchart\n\n2. Netflix Stock\n\nAfter its latest blowout earnings report, streaming giant Netflix NFLX is next up on our list as a potential new entrant in the “Magnificent Seven” club. Established in 1997, Netflix is a global subscription streaming service, primarily offering original and acquired films and TV shows that are personalized according to the viewer's preferences. Its market cap currently stands at $248.1 billion.\n\nNetflix stock has rallied 19.6% on a YTD basis, easily outperforming the broader equities market. Barchart\n\nFor the December quarter, Netflix posted a robust set of numbers, highlighted by a significant jump in the bottom line. While revenues rose by 12.5% from the previous year to $8.8 billion, this pales in comparison to the streamer's earnings growth. EPS shot up from a mere $0.12 in the prior year to $2.11 in the latest quarter, though still fell short of consensus estimates.\n\nHowever, investors overlooked the EPS shortfall, as Netflix shattered subscriber growth expectations by adding 13.1 million members globally during Q4.\n\nWith its laser focus on content and a large dedicated user base, Netflix outshines its upstart streaming competitors, with its shows dominating the ratings charts consistently. Coupled with one of the lowest churn rates in the industry and a strong lineup of shows set for 2024, the company is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in streaming.\n\nAnalysts are largely optimistic about Netflix stock, with a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” and a Street-high target price of $700. This denotes an upside potential of about 19.6% from current levels. Out of 40 analysts covering the stock, 22 have a “Strong Buy” rating, 1 has a “Moderate Buy” rating, 15 have a “Hold” rating, and 2 have a “Strong Sell” rating. Barchart\n\n3. Eli Lilly Stock\n\nWe round out our list with Eli Lilly and Company LLY, whose market value has soared as its anti-obesity drugs explode in popularity. Eli Lilly was founded in 1876, and is a pharmaceutical company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of human and animal health products. With its products selling in 125 countries worldwide, the company's market cap currently stands at a mammoth $708 billion.\n\nEli Lilly stock is up by an impressive 32% on a YTD basis. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 0.7%, and these shareholder payouts have grown consistently for the past nine years. Barchart\n\nEli Lilly recently reported its results for the fourth quarter, and delivered solid growth in both revenue and earnings. Revenues rose by 28% from the prior year to $9.3 billion, while EPS grew by 19% to $2.49. Both figures surpassed Wall Street's consensus estimates.\n\nThe drug giant also remains confident that revenues will continue to grow in 2024. Beyond its blockbuster weight-loss and diabetes drugs, LLY recently landed approval for Ebglyss (approved in November by the European Commission for the treatment of atopic dermatitis), Jaypirca (approved in December by the FDA for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia), and Omvoh (approved by the FDA in October for the treatment of ulcerative colitis). Overall, the company expects to generate revenues of $40.4 billion to $41.6 billion for fiscal year 2024, compared to $34.12 billion in 2023.\n\nAnalysts have an average rating of “Strong Buy” for LLY stock, which has a Street-high target price of $950. This indicates an upside potential of about 23% from current levels. Out of 21 analysts covering the stock, 18 have a “Strong Buy” rating, 1 has a “Moderate Buy” rating, and 2 have a “Hold” rating.

Just ask Tesla (TSLA). But as Meta Platforms (META) shows, the return of a prodigal stock can be glorious.\n\nX\n\nWhile Tesla struggles to correct its long slide off a string of downturns since 2021, Meta stock has now skyrocketed as much as 461% from its lows in November 2022 to another record it just hit Friday.\n\nThe Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp parent has set up a new launchpad for even more gains. Holding most of its surge from a gap-up on Q4 earnings, Meta stock traded sideways to form a three-weeks-tight pattern.\n\nThe top of that formation around 485.96 sets the buy point. After Meta gapped up past that entry in rising and above-average volume Thursday, the stock eased off its intraday highs Friday to close in buy range at 484.03.\n\nNote that a three-weeks-tight pattern is typically considered a place to add shares to an existing position rather than start a new one. The number of shares purchased for add-on buys should be less than for earlier positions to keep the average share price down.\n\nNvidia Delivers Another Beat-And-Raise Quarter Fueled By AI Chips\n\nMeta Vs. Tesla: A Tale Of Two Stocks\n\nTesla's recent turmoil does not mean the EV pioneer cannot rebound. It certainly can, and Wall Street forecasts for 2025 call for the company to recharge and deliver a spike to 38% earnings growth in 2025.\n\nBut a quick comparison of both the fundamentals and technical action in Meta and Tesla paints a clear picture.\n\nAfter a severe slump of its own from 2022 to early 2023, Meta has generated three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth. In Q4, the Mark Zuckerberg-led social media giant posted earnings of $5.33 per share, a 203% jump over the prior-year quarter.\n\nTesla, on the other hand, has seen profits decelerate in three of the last four quarters. Earnings for the fourth quarter slowed 40% to 71 cents a share.\n\nRevenue for Tesla has declined over the last two quarters, sliding to just 3% year-over-year growth in Q4. Meanwhile, Meta continues to build on its growth trajectory. From 3% sales growth to $28.6 billion in Q1, Meta Platforms drove a 25% year-over-year gain to $40.1 billion in Q4.\n\nThe powerful action in the chart for Meta stock reflects that turnaround in the company's fundamentals. The reverse is true for the troubles in Tesla stock.\n\nMeta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google Spur Demand From Top Funds\n\nInstitutional demand plays another key role in the Tesla vs. Meta stock story.\n\nAlong with Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet, Meta made this month's list of new buys by the best mutual funds. In fact, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia each took in over well over $1 billion from these top money managers. Tesla has not made this list since August.\n\nThe ratings for all the Magnificent Seven stocks further highlight the gap between Meta and Tesla. For example, while Meta joins Nvidia in sporting the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, Tesla earns a lowly 43.\n\nThe up/volume ratio is another key measure of interest among investors. Where anything above 1.0 points to demand, Meta scores a 1.6, while Tesla rates 0.8.\n\nCompany Symbol Comp Rating EPS Rating RS Rating Ind Group RS SMR Rating A/D Rating Meta Platforms (META) 99 96 97 A+ A B+ Nvidia (NVDA) 99 99 98 A+ A C+ Amazon.com (AMZN) 98 82 93 A A B+ Alphabet (GOOGL) 94 98 81 A+ A D+ Microsoft (MSFT) 93 97 87 C- A C+ Apple (AAPL) 73 94 53 C- A C Tesla (TSLA) 43 69 22 B- B D+\n\nFollow Matthew Galgani on X (formerly Twitter) at @IBD_MGalgani.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nEV Evisceration: Elon Musk Says A Bankruptcy May Be Looming\n\nYes, Nvidia Is One.

Here’s an analysis of whether this is a likely scenario to occur in 2024.\n\nIn 2022, Tesla TSLA -2.8% announced a plan to split its stock for the second time in as many years. Some investors are wondering if the two-year split cadence will repeat itself in 2024.\n\nBelow we'll look at Tesla's stock split history, share price considerations and other factors to assess the likelihood of a split this year. We'll also cover the short- and long-term implications if Tesla does multiply its outstanding share count in 2024.\n\nUnderstanding The Tesla Stock Split Landscape\n\nLet's start with some context, including Tesla's split history and how the stock price responded to those transactions in the short-term.\n\nTSLA's Stock Split History\n\nTesla stock has split twice previously. The first was a five-for-one exchange on August 31, 2020. Two years later, on August 25, 2022, the company implemented a three-for-one split.\n\nMarket Sentiment And Speculation\n\nStock splits are superficial in that they don't change a company's market value. They instead reallocate that value into a different number of shares.\n\nStill, a split can affect the prevailing sentiment on a stock. For example, some see a stock split as a signal that the leadership team is bullish. Another theory is that splits make stocks more attractive to a wider investor base by lowering the share price. Both views imply that splits can indirectly increase a company's value and, in turn, raise share prices over time.\n\nWith respect to Tesla, however, the numbers don't show an obvious and immediate uptick. See the table below, which shows how Tesla stock moved before and after each of its two prior splits. For context, the corresponding changes in the Nasdaq-100 and the S&P 500 are also included. The percentages are calculated from adjusted stock prices, so the effect of the split itself is eliminated.\n\nYou can see that both post-split timeframes were tough for TSLA and the two indexes. You can also conclude that Tesla was more volatile in these timeframes than the indexes. And finally, in these two cases, Tesla investors seemed more excited about the stock splits before they happened vs. after.\n\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024. Download one of Forbes' most popular and widely anticipated reports, 12 Best Stocks To Buy for 2024.\n\nFactors That May Influence A Potential TSLA Stock Split\n\nLeadership teams typically pursue stock splits to manage the share price and to promote the liquidity and accessibility of the stock.\n\nShare Price Considerations\n\nBefore Tesla split in 2020, the stock was trading in the range of $2,200. After the five-for-one exchange, the share price dipped down to about $440. In 2022, the three-for-one split shifted the price of TSLA from $900 down to $300.\n\nToday, TSLA trades around $200 per share. That's lower than the post-split price on the stock in 2022, so a split now seems improbable.\n\nThe question is, at what share price will Tesla's leaders start thinking about the next split? As Tesla grows and matures, the company will get more aggressive about split points. So, you would expect another split to occur well before TSLA hits $900. Given the details of the two previous splits, a two-for-one exchange when the share price exceeds $350 would make sense.\n\nLiquidity And Accessibility\n\nThe common end-goal of holding share prices low through splits is to improve the stock's liquidity and accessibility. A stock's liquidity relates to how easily it can be bought and sold. This is a function of demand; if many investors are willing to buy, selling investors can liquidate their shares quickly.\n\nFor exchange-traded stocks like TSLA, accessibility is driven primarily by the share price. Few retail investors, for example, can afford a single share of Berkshire-Hathaway (BRK.A), which costs more than $600,000. But many individuals can afford, say, $100 or $200 for a piece of Tesla.\n\nTesla hasn't targeted a $100 share price yet, but that could change as the company matures. If that were the goal today, Tesla could make it happen with a two-for-one split in 2024.\n\nStop chasing shadows in the market. Forbes' expert analysts have pinpointed the 12 superstars poised to ignite returns in 2024. Don't miss out—download 12 Best Stocks To Buy For 2024 and claim your front-row seat to the coming boom.\n\nPotential Stock Split Implications For Tesla Shareholders\n\nSo, what would happen if Tesla split its stock this year? Let's touch on the short-term and long-term implications.\n\nShort-Term Considerations\n\nStock split plans generate buzz, which can drive share prices up in the short-term. Unfortunately, share price gains driven by buzz alone often don't last, especially for volatile stocks like Tesla.\n\nAs an example, Tesla announced its 2022 split in March. Shareholders approved the split in August and the transaction was implemented later that month. Between March and August, Tesla's share price rose, fell and recovered—finishing out August with a slight gain.\n\nShould that volatility repeat when Tesla announces its next split, there will be opportunity for the savviest short-term traders.\n\nLooking beyond the immediate term, there is some empirical evidence that split stocks tend to outperform the market for one to three years following the change. This is largely due to investor perception vs. fundamental business improvements, so it can be fleeting.\n\nTesla did perform well in the three years following the 2020 split but has lagged the market since its 2022 split.\n\nLong-Term Outlook\n\nLonger-term, Tesla should benefit from holding its share price low. But that benefit only applies if the business continues delivering acceptable shareholder returns.\n\nTo that end, Tesla is entering an interesting period in its evolution. The company has lowered its prices in recent years to stimulate demand. That's putting pressure on margins and profitability just as Tesla's EV competition is on the rise.\n\nCEO Elon Musk personally creates another layer of challenge for the company. While Musk is credited with masterminding Tesla's growth to date, he has a history of creating negative headlines and distractions. Most recently, reports have surfaced alleging illegal drug use by Musk and Tesla board members.\n\nWith those moving pieces in play, a stock split isn't going to make or break Tesla long term. More important will be the company's ability to manage through increased competition, lower margins and the drug-use scandal in 2024.\n\nIs Tesla Stock Likely To Split In 2024?\n\nI don't see Tesla stock splitting this year. The share price is about 30% lower now than it was after the 2022 split. That negates any argument about keeping the share price affordable, since the stock has done that on its own.\n\nIf TSLA were expected to rise some 75% to the mid-$300s this year, the story would be different. In that case, you'd see Tesla on lists of the best stocks for 2024 and split conversations would be ongoing.\n\nUnfortunately, most analysts aren't predicting that kind of growth. According to Yahoo Finance, the TSLA price targets range from $22.57 to $320.06. The average is $192.73, which represents a slight decrease from the current share price of $199.95.\n\nTesla's outlook could change for the better if the company’s newly launched Cybertruck makes a big splash. Tesla began delivering the new model in November 2023 with a starting price point of $81,000. The truck is reported to have a towing capacity of 11,000 pounds and a range of 340 miles per charge.\n\nTesla also has growing opportunity in its energy generation and storage business, which quadrupled its sales in 2023. That growth doesn't exactly position Tesla among the best energy stocks, but it's a nice source of revenue diversification.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTesla has split its stock twice in company history. While some believe the EV-maker is due for a third split in 2024, that probably won't happen unless the share price rises significantly from where it is now.\n\nRead Next\n\nThe brain trust at Forbes has run the numbers, conducted the research, and done the analysis to come up with some of the best places for you to make money in 2024.

Elon Musk discloses remarkable feat accomplished by first human Neuralink patient\n\nThe filling says that the stake Elon Musk has in Tesla compromises of 411.06 million shares of Tesla common stock, as well as options to purchase 303.96 million shares that are exercisable with 60 days of December 31.\n\nMusk has stated publicly that he hopes to gain a 25 percent stake in the EV company, as he wishes to have more influence over the company.\n\nNot only that, but this would keep him incentivized to work on various projects underneath the Tesla brand, such as robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nMinistério Das Comunicações / Wikimedia Commons\n\n“I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk posted to X last month.\n\n“Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla,” he added.\n\nIt’s worth noting, though, Musk’s huge ownership stake in Tesla had largely in part been driven by his 2018 compensation package, for which he has faced challenges in court.\n\nThe $55 billion pay package saw Elon Musk awarded tranches of company stock if he hit certain milestones in growing Tesla’s market capitalization.\n\nJérémy Barande / Wikimedia Commons – Ben Shapiro / YouTube\n\nThe massive stake Elon Musk has in Tesla, combined with his ownership stakes in SpaceX and X, makes him the second richest person in the world behind Bernard Arnault.\n\nArnault is the CEO of LVMH, a conglomerate that controls a variety of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer, and Tiffany & Co.\n\nMuch like Musk’s with Tesla stock, Arnault’s net worth is tied to the performance of LVMH’s stock.\n\nArnault overtook Musk in January to become the world’s richest man – and it’s not the first time it’s happened.\n\nAntoine Arnault / Instagram\n\nArnault has overtaken Musk twice before – the first time in the summer of 2023, and then a second time, in January.\n\nWhat’s different now is that the other two times it was just by around a billion, whereas this time the margin is over $18 billion.\n\nAt the time of writing, Arnault has a net worth of $224.4 billion, while Musk has a net worth of $206 billion.\n\nSome of the images for this article were created using AI."}

With all the price cuts on EVs, it’s a great time to buy one, but the TSLA stock analysis suggests it’s not so good for EV stocks. Tesla might have been the first company to lower prices, but it’s got plenty of company.\n\n“This year also marks the beginning of a fierce competition that may end in a ‘bloodbath’ (or as I prefer to call it, the brutal ‘knockout round’) among Chinese auto makers,” Xiaopeng wrote in the employee memo,” CNBC reported CEO He Xiaopeng’s comments in a memo to employees. “XPeng has engaged in this cutthroat competition right from the outset, thus accumulating considerable experience. Our guts, grit and perseverance, I firmly believe, will lead us to victory.”\n\nBring it on, Tesla, Xiaopeng appears to be saying. That’s terrible news for Tesla shareholders. You might want to hold tight if you’re considering buying TSLA stock. Here’s why.\n\nCybertruck: A Bridge Too Far\n\nI recently argued that Nio’s (NYSE: NIO ) expansion plan made no sense, given it already had nine models compared to five for Tesla. From Tesla’s perspective, it’s made money by keeping its model number low and its margins high.\n\nOf course, with the slashing of prices, Tesla’s Q4 2023 operating margin fell by 50% to 8%. Wall Street expects it won’t be much better in the first quarter, coming in at 9%, well below its 2022 level of 17%.\n\nThere is no question Elon Musk believes that a prolonged price war with its competitors in China will enable it to capture future market share as its competitors go out of business. So far, that hasn’t happened with Xpeng and others following Tesla down the price-cutting hole.\n\nI suspect that Tesla’s undoing won’t be because of price cuts. Instead, it will be the Cybertruck that takes it down. In terms of vehicle development, it is a bridge too far.\n\nRecently, Cybertruck owners posted photos of the truck rusting on social media. That’s not a good look for a vehicle that can cost $100,000 and looks anything but attractive.\n\nTesla employee Wes Morrill suggested the photos showed “rust dust,” that had collected on the vehicle as they transported it to its final destination. One can use a blue, non-scratch Scotch Brite pad to wipe it off.\n\nMaybe so, but I’ve always wondered why Tesla went with such a wild-looking vehicle when the most popular type in America is the crossover SUV, which accounts for more than 45% of all vehicles sold.\n\nIf price cuts were inevitable, it would have been helpful to use lower prices for an affordable crossover SUV, not an expensive, ugly monster truck with limited appeal and demographics.\n\nTSLA Stock Analysis: Cybertruck Is a Drag\n\nIt would be different if the EV market were going gangbusters right now. That’s not the case with companies worldwide unloading excess inventory because of lower demand caused by higher interest rates.\n\nWall Street often talks about “catalysts” for moving stocks higher. Tangible information and news that suggests revenue and profit growth are on the horizon.\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Brian Sponheimer recently told Yahoo Finance that now is not a good time to buy EV stocks.\n\n“We are value investors, and while the automakers are statistically inexpensive, investors face prospects for considerable CAPEX, reduced margins, and an uncertain outcome as it relates to electric vehicle market share,” Sponheimer recently told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWith Tesla trading at 200x earnings, Sponheimer suggests that Tesla’s too expensive right now for value investors like himself. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider TSLA stock at current prices because the future looks bright for EV development.\n\nHowever, despite Tesla being down 22% in the first two months of 2024, it needs to fall further for Sponheimer to think about buying.\n\nI’m neither buying nor selling TSLA stock at the moment. If you own it, don’t sell it. If you don’t, according to my TSLA stock analysis, wait for a better entry point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Most of these companies have already crashed by double-digits this year and analysts caution that the situation may worsen soon.\n\nLucid Motors and Rivian earnings\n\nCopy link to section\n\nThere have been several bad news in the EV industry lately. Earlier this week, Ford announced that it was slashing prices of its Mach E vehicle again in a sign that demand was waning. It was also reported by WSJ that EV demand in China was starting to wane.\n\nThe weakness of the Chinese market is important because companies in the country are building millions of EVs every year. The risk is that this overproduction will flood the market with vehicles, leading to lower prices, thinner margins, and a lack of clarity on when companies will become profitable.\n\nThe performance of EV companies is a big contrast to that of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles like Toyota, Honda, and Ferrari. These stocks have all jumped to their record highs in a sign that there is strong demand.\n\nThe other notable news came on Wednesday when Lucid Group and Rivian Motors published weak financial results.\n\nFeatured Broker Looking to invest?

Ad\n\nLucid, the Saudi Arabia-backed company, said that its losses widened in Q4 as its sales plunged by over 39%, This explains why the company has been cutting prices in the past two months as it seeks to boost demand.\n\nAre you looking for fast-news, hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter, today.\n\nLucid made 8,428 vehicles in 2023 and 2,390 in the fourth quarter. Its revenue jumped by just 14% to $154 million as the cost of revenue came in at $410 million. This means that the company is losing over $300k for every vehicle it sells.\n\nWorse, it is unclear how long Saudi Arabia will continue throwing money at the company since its budget is being strained. The government now plans to raise funds by selling shares in Saudi Aramco, its oil company.\n\nRivian is also not doing all that well even as its revenue jumped by 98% to $1.32 billion. Its gross profit was minus $606 million, meaning that the company is losing $43,000 for every vehicle it sells. It now expects to build and deliver 57k vehicles this year.\n\nTSLA vs LCID vs RIVN vs NIO vs VFS\n\nOutlook for Nio, Tesla, and VinFast\n\nCopy link to section\n\nThese results are bad news for all EV companies since they show that the industry is doing worse than expected. This explains why most stocks, including Tesla, have plunged in the pre-market session.\n\nNio, the Chinese EV company, was trading at $5.97, much lower than its all-time high of $67. This means that it has crashed by over 91%. Nio’s challenge, as I wrote recently, is that its Chinese market is slowing and its vehicles are not doing well in European countries.\n\nWorse, the stock has formed a head and shoulders pattern, pointing to more downside in the coming months. If this happens, the shares could crash from the current $5.97 to about $4.\n\nVinFast stock price, on the other hand, has plummeted by over 99% from its all-time high. But despite this crash, the company is still overvalued considering that it has over $12 billion in market cap.\n\nThe company is expected to raise additional capital for its American business. Besides, its balance sheet shows that it has just $139 million in cash and equivalents. Building and running an EV plant is quite expensive.\n\nTesla is also not doing well, which explains why the company has intensified its price cuts. Lucid’s and Rivian’s results show that demand is not doing well. Worse, BYD plans to launch a plant in Mexico, in a move that will put more pressure on Tesla. BYD has already overtaken Tesla in China and this trend could happen in the US.\n\nTherefore, my view is where the TSLA stock plunges to last year’s low of $102.94, which is about 47% below the current level."}

Its shares were up about 15% in early trading.\n\nBetter-than-expected isn’t the word investors will use to describe results posted Wednesday evening at Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group LCID -1.95% . Rivian management said they expect to make 57,000 vehicles in 2024, up from about 50,000 in 2023, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 66,000. Lucid expects to make about 9,000 vehicles in 2024, up from the roughly 6,000 it sold in 2023 but far below the 12,000 Wall Street had expected.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up The Barron's Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers. Preview Subscribed\n\nLucid stock was down 19% in morning trading, while Rivian shares fell almost 27%.\n\nThe weaker-than-expected results caught the attention of Tesla TSLA -2.76% CEO Elon Musk. He said Wednesday night in response to a question on the social-media platform X that the “current trajectory has [Rivian] bankrupt in about six quarters. Maybe that trajectory will change, but so far it hasn’t.” He included a chart of Rivian’s falling cash balance.\n\nRivian isn’t profitable yet. It ended the year with almost $10 billion in cash and investments on its books. Management has said that is enough for the company to fund itself through 2025; the company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGary Black, co-founder of the Future Fund Active ETF External link , which has invested in Tesla, said he was confused as to why Musk would be commenting on the competition at all. Rivian’s problems aren’t necessarily good for Tesla, he said, even if they could eventually remove a competitor.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\n“Further near-term demand or pricing pressures [could] limit Tesla upside,” he said.\n\nLoading tweet...\n\nTesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the tweet.\n\nTesla, of course, is profitable and generates free cash flow. That is one reason its shares are riding out the effects of Rivian’s and Lucid’s results.\n\nAnother reason Tesla stock is outperforming its peers in Thursday trading boils down to pricing. The average price for a Lucid vehicle—taking sales and dividing by units sold—worked out to about $91,000 in the fourth quarter. The average price for a Rivian vehicle was $94,000, while Tesla’s average price for the fourth quarter was about $44,000. It is the only one of the three that makes relatively affordable EVs.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nWhat is more, the market for high-end EVs is saturated in the U.S. All-battery EVs from luxury brands, including Tesla, accounted for some 40% of total U.S. luxury-vehicle sales this past year.\n\nBattery-electric penetration of nonluxury cars amounted to roughly 2% of new car sales in 2023. Americans need cheaper EVs if electric cars are to make serious inroads in the market.\n\nShares of other Tesla peers were also moving. NIO shares were down 3.6% in early trading. BYD stock was flat in Hong Kong trading. Ford Motor stock was up 0.5%, and General Motors GM 0.74% stock was up 0.4%.\n\nTesla stock is well off its 52-week high of $299.29, set last summer."}

Please consult our website policy prior to making financial decisions.\n\nTiming the market is of critical importance when it comes to stock investing. It is often the difference between a loss and double-digit gains over a certain time period. The drawback is that timing the market could lead to missing out on gains and habituating emotional trading.\n\nWith this in mind, Tesla’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock has broken even over one year. While the S&P 500 index rose 24%, TSLA shares are down 0.32%. Year-to-date, TSLA is down 20%. In market cap terms, this means that Tesla lost $162 billion of value, roughly half that of Toyota (NYSE: TM).\n\nAlongside Ford Motor (NYSE: F), Tesla was one of the most shorted stocks in 2023.\n\nGiven these lackluster returns and market sentiment, can Tesla still be considered a growth stock, or does it have room to rally in the second half of 2024 with the expected interest rate cuts?\n\nReasons for Tesla’s Poor Performance in 2024\n\nIn Tesla’s Q4 2023 earnings, the company reported a 23% downturn in year-over-year gross profits, at $25.1 billion. Total EV revenue at $21.5 billion barely entered the positive zone of 1% growth for the quarter.\n\nMost tellingly, Tesla’s operating margin decreased by 784 basis points for the quarter at 8.2%, indicating a significant reduction in cost-effectiveness and supply chain issues. For comparison, Tesla’s operating margin was 16% in Q4 2022.\n\nRegarding earnings per share (EPS) for the full year (diluted GAAP), TSLA stock tracked 19% growth from $3.62 in 2022 to $4.07 in 2023. In short, Tesla missed both key quarterly earnings estimates, EPS of $0.71 vs expected $0.73 and revenue of $25.167 billion vs expected $25.640 billion.\n\nJoin our Telegram group and never miss a breaking story.\n\nTesla’s Economies of Scale Problem\n\nFocusing on performant electric vehicles was one of the initial drivers of Tesla’s success. However, that came at the cost of offering the luxury EV category as a base model. The company’s cheapest model is Model 3, which has a $40,380 price tag as of January. This represents a substantial adoption hurdle.\n\nS&P Global Mobility Survey found that 48% of respondents view EV prices as too high for comfort, with 62% waiting for the technology to improve before considering EV purchases. For that to change, the battery cost has to come down, in addition to manufacturing automation.\n\nElon Musk pushed mold vehicle chassis to streamline this process, manifesting in Tesla’s latest offering – Cybertruck. Likewise, Tesla aims to become self-sufficient in mass-producing new batteries. Yet, both Musk and experts believe scaling batteries will be a difficult long-term proposal given the fluctuating supply of rare earth minerals.\n\n“It’s really, really difficult to manufacture at a speed and at scale.” Shirley Meng, University of Chicago, previously working with Tesla-acquired Maxwell battery company.\n\nIn the meantime, Tesla continues to rely on Panasonic and LG Energy Solution, as well as Chinese Ganfeng Lithium and Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL). According to Nikkei analysis, as much as 39% of battery materials for Tesla EVs come from China.\n\nRegarding chokepoint reliance, Tesla received the highest rating of 10, per Fronteo’s chokepoint score index. This is not favorable amid contentious US-China relations. Likewise, it gives the USG leverage over the company following Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition.\n\nTesla’s Green Credit Boost, Competition and Recession\n\nChina and the US heavily boosted EV adoption with the so-called green credits. Included in the Inflation Reduction Act, Tesla lost up to $7,500 in green credits for its Model 3 RWD and LR, reduced to $3.750 since January 1, 2024.\n\nThis comes from USG’s intent to prevent battery sourcing from countries like China. At the same time, Tesla was forced to cut prices multiple times to compete in the Chinese market against BYD, Li Auto, NIO, and Xpeng Motors.\n\nTesla produced 1,845,985 cars in 2023 compared to 1,369,611 in 2022, representing a 35% year-over-year production growth. Given that the New York Fed forecasts a 61.47% recession probability by January 2025, compared to a long-term average of 14.60%, Tesla’s car sales are likely to be negatively impacted.\n\nTesla’s Long Term Prospect\n\nIt bears noting that Tesla reported a record-high free cash flow of $2 billion in Q4 ‘23, a 45% year-over-year increase. Companies typically stack strong free cash flow ahead of economic contractions (recessions) to power through.\n\nSo far, Tesla’s revenue CAGR for five years is 35.2%, under the 50% that Elon Musk forecasted in early 2021. Equally so, in January 2022, Musk said that he expects growth to be “comfortably above 50%” in 2022. If a recession unfolds this year, the company could fail to deliver this goal for the third consecutive year.\n\nHowever, given Tesla’s dominant EV market position in the US, the long prospect of scaling production and batteries remains in Elon Musk’s favor. Based on 32 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq, TSLA stock is a “buy” 12 months ahead. The average TSLA price target is $218.75 vs the current $194.77. The high estimate is $345, while the lowest forecast is $23.53 per share.\n\nDo you think Tesla will lose its luster as a high-growth tech stock and become another car company stock?

Some strategists predict that anything less than a blowout report might derail a surge that has put Nvidia’s stock up 40% by 2024.\n\nNvidia’s shares fell roughly 5% on Tuesday, suggesting market concerns ahead of the release.\n\nOver the last 30 sessions, around $30 billion worth of Nvidia shares changed hands per day on average, surpassing Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker, which averaged $22 billion.\n\nTesla has dominated daily U.S. stock trading since 2020, according to LSEG statistics, with turnover—a stock’s share price multiplied by the number of shares exchanged—exceeding $35 billion numerous times in recent years.\n\nOn Tuesday, combined trading in Nvidia and Super Micro Computer (SMCI.O), another company benefiting from the AI boom, accounted for 46% of all turnover of the ten most traded U.S. stocks, including Tesla, Meta Platforms (META.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), and Microsoft (MSFT.O).\n\n“There’s an argument here that this is the dawn of a new era of trading, like the dawn of the internet, with Nvidia in the pole position,” said Dennis Dick, a financial analyst.\n\nHowever, Dick cautioned that the strong turnover in AI-related equities shows that individual investors and algorithmic traders are driving share prices higher primarily on momentum rather than fundamentals, such as expectations for future revenue growth.\n\nSuper Micro, which provides AI-related server components to Nvidia, has nearly tripled its worth to $43 billion so far in 2024. It slid nearly 5% on Tuesday, following a 20% drop from record highs on Friday, after Wells Fargo began covering the stock with an equal weight recommendation, stating that its value already discounts “solid upside.”.\n\nNvidia controls over 80% of the high-end AI chip industry, and last week its market value surpassed Amazon’s and Alphabet’s, making it Wall Street’s third-most valuable business, after only Microsoft and Apple.\n\nFollowing Tuesday’s selloff in Nvidia shares, Alphabet and Amazon’s stock market valuations both retreated ahead of the chipmaker. Nvidia’s stock market value last year stood at $1.7 trillion, up from $540 billion the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla’s stock has fallen 23% in 2024 as it battles low demand for its electric vehicles and increased competition.\n\nAlso read: As a technology leader, I cultivated the knack of understanding one step above the others so that I can handle them, says Dr. Chandran Raghuraman, CTO at Bahwan Cybertek\n\nDo Follow: CIO News LinkedIn Account | CIO News Facebook | CIO News Youtube | CIO News Twitter\n\nAbout us:\n\nCIO News, a proprietary of Mercadeo, produces award-winning content and resources for IT leaders across any industry through print articles and recorded video interviews on topics in the technology sector such as Digital Transformation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Cloud, Robotics, Cyber-security, Data, Analytics, SOC, SASE, among other technology topics."}

TSLA bull on Wednesday took stock of his investment thesis for the electric vehicle giant’s stock as it remains stuck in a lackluster trading range.\n\nWhat Happened: “I’ve been wrong on $TSLA for three years now,” said Future Fund’s Gary Black, adding that the stock has been his “worst-performing long” during the period when Tesla fell 19% compared to a 32% gain for the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nFuture Fund has Tesla as the third-highest holding of its Future Fund Active ETF FFND.\n\nBlack conceded that he was wrong about volume trajectory. Tesla’s volume growth has slowed despite its massive price cuts and electric-vehicle credits, he said. The company estimated 15% year-over-year volume growth for 2024, down from the 38% growth seen in 2023, he noted.\n\n“Where I've been massively wrong is not anticipating that TSLA would start a price war, which has caused TSLA 2024 and 2025 earnings power to collapse (-45% over past 12 months),” the Tesla investor said.\n\n“This has been my greatest research mistake,” Black said. The rumored $25,000 Model 2, which he believed could satisfy the affordability issue, has been pushed back to late 2025 at least, he said.\n\n“So price cuts to drive volumes were in hindsight inevitable,” he said.\n\nSee Also: Everything You Need To Know About Tesla Stock\n\nSpot On FSD Prediction: But Black credited himself for being right on the full-self driving software. “That it would not get to L4 for many years after Elon predicted FSD would drive itself and so I always assumed zero value for Robotaxi in my valuation,” he said.\n\nDespite FSD improving significantly as a driver-assist tool, its take rates languished in the low teens, the fund manager said. The technology, the analyst said, currently added 14 cents per share to the estimated earnings per share for 2024.\n\nStill Bullish: Black said he still thinks he will be vindicated on his Tesla price target of $290. He premised his optimism on his expectations that the other EV makers would either give up or cut back on their EV investments. He, however, cautioned against further price cuts.\n\n“Further TSLA price cuts would crush my investment thesis that auto gross margins bottomed at 16.3% in 3Q and are now headed upward as TSLA mgmt learns that they got little from last year's price cuts.”\n\n“When I make a bad trade as I have with $TSLA, I have only myself to blame. The shorts have done little to cause $TSLA price to decline; the damage to the stock has been largely self-inflicted which I should have foreseen.”\n\nTo get to his $290 price target, the Tesla management should learn to use marketing tools other than price, Black said. Despite the current fundamental problems, the fund manager remains firmly bullish on the stock. “But I am optimistic and remain a $TSLA bull,” he said.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Walmart’s Solid Quarter Proves Tesla ‘Uberbulls’ Wrong?

The move was pushed by Tripadvisor’s controlling shareholder, Greg Maffei, but was opposed by shareholders who argued that Maffei’s goal was to evade accountability in Delaware courts.\n\nLaster ruled that the company's shareholders can try to recover damages, because moving out of Delaware means they will give up certain litigation rights under Nevada’s business-friendly laws. But he also said Delaware courts will only block companies from ditching Delaware under extreme circumstances.\n\nThat’s helpful language for Tesla TSLA and Musk, who called last month for Tesla shareholders to vote on a move to Texas after a Delaware judge invalidated his $56 billion pay package.\n\nEven more helpful: The Delaware judge laid out how companies with a controlling shareholder can move out of the state without leaving themselves open to claims by other shareholders.\n\nGenerally speaking, Delaware courts give extra scrutiny to business decisions by corporations controlled by one shareholder, usually through the ownership of a majority of the company’s shares. Musk does not own a majority stake in Tesla, but in a couple of recent cases — most notably, the case challenging Musk’s pay package — Delaware judges have deemed Musk to be a controlling shareholder.\n\nCompanies can avoid the extra scrutiny, as Laster explained in the Tripadvisor decision, if they meet two requirements. First, the board must create a special committee of directors who are independent of the controlling shareholder. That committee must reach an independent determination of the best course for the company.\n\nAnd second, a majority of independent shareholders must ratify the board’s decision in a fully informed vote.\n\nThe Tripadvisor opinion leaves no doubt that the two-step “cleansing,” process, to use Delaware lingo, applies when a controlled company decides to abandon Delaware for a friendlier jurisdiction.\n\n“If the question is whether a company can come up with a mechanism to get out of Delaware, the answer is absolutely yes,” said shareholder lawyer Randall Baron of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, who led an unsuccessful 2022 challenge to Tesla’s allegedly conflicted acquisition of a solar energy company controlled by Musk. “I don’t think Delaware wants the reputation of being the Hotel California.\"\n\nSo if it’s clear that a theoretical company can take advantage of the two-step cleansing process to exit Delaware without incurring liability to minority shareholders, the question is whether Tesla, specifically, can rely on such cleansing if its board decides to make the move to Texas.\n\nNeither a Tesla spokesperson nor Musk’s go-to outside counsel, Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, responded to my query. But I talked to three law professors and two shareholders about whether Tesla will be able to convince a Delaware court that it is entitled to deference on a decision to move out of the state.\n\nTheir answers ranged from possibly to probably not — and all agreed that Musk has made things harder for Tesla’s board by loudly advocating for the company to reincorporate in Texas.\n\nShareholder lawyer Joel Fleming of the Equity Litigation Group and law professor Ann Lipton of Tulane University said that Musk’s actions, including a poll of his followers on X about moving Tesla out of Delaware, will allow dissenting shareholders to argue that the board’s consideration of the move was tainted, since Musk has already said unequivocally that he wants the company to reincorporate in Texas.\n\n“The idea to move out should probably not start with the controlling shareholder,” said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School. “Tesla is starting with one glove tied behind its back.”\n\nIt might nevertheless be possible, said Talley and law professor Jill Fisch of the University of Pennsylvania, for Tesla to convince a Delaware judge that independent board members reached an unconflicted determination to reincorporate in Texas. That could require Tesla to appoint a new director without any ties to Musk, Fisch said.\n\nWould shareholders outside of Musk’s control vote for the move to Texas, as required in step two of the cleansing process?\n\nMusk’s fans likely would, but Talley, Fisch and Fleming pointed out that plenty of institutional investors also own Tesla stock. Those investors typically pay attention to recommendations from the big shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS — and at least one of those firms, Fisch predicted, will likely oppose Tesla’s move out of Delaware.\n\nThen there’s the requirement that any shareholder vote must be fully informed. To meet that standard, Tesla would have to file voluminous proxy disclosures about Musk’s anti-Delaware agitation. And no matter how fulsome the disclosures, said Fleming and law professor Lipton, shareholders who oppose a move to Texas will probably file lawsuits claiming that the proxy left out important information.\n\nThere is a wildcard here: If Musk and Tesla delay making the move to Texas, they may get a boost from Delaware’s Supreme Court.\n\nIn a case involving the spinoff of dating site Match.com, the state justices are right now considering whether to pay greater deference to the boards of the controlled companies in all transactions except for deals to squeeze out minority shareholders. The Delaware justices’ decision could end up helping Tesla fend off any shareholder challenge to a board decision to move out of the state.\n\nThat would be an ironic outcome: Delaware’s highest court showing its faith in corporate boards, only to see Tesla capitalize on that deference to leave the state.\n\nRead more:\n\nTripAdvisor can ditch Delaware in case Elon Musk highlighted\n\nExplainer — Did Delaware 'lock the doors' to stop companies from leaving, as Musk claims?\n\nJudge voids Elon Musk's 'unfathomable' $56 billion Tesla pay package"}

Also in January, quarterly reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and ASML (ASML) gave chip stocks a boost.\n\nEarlier in January, the leading maker of artificial intelligence chips disclosed at CES new GeForce graphic processors. The chips are designed for AI-enabled laptops and PCs. It also said electric vehicles are using its automated driving system. Li Auto (LI) and other EV makers have selected Nvidia Drive Thor for their fleets.\n\nThe leader in AI chips rallied 239% in 2023 and hit an all-time high 505.48 just before the year ended. Then it topped, the 505.48 buy point of its base in heavy volume on Jan. 8.\n\nNvidia Stock: Third-Quarter Earnings\n\nShares broke out of a double-bottom base just ahead of third-quarter earnings in November.\n\nA week before reporting results, Nvidia announced at the SC23 supercomputing conference in Denver a new artificial intelligence computing platform and an advanced data-center chip. That sent the stock to its all-time high.\n\nDespite a blockbuster quarter, shares fell after the earnings report. The company said profits came in at $4.02 a share. That came on sales of $18.12 billion for the period ended Oct. 29. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $3.37 a share on sales of $16.19 billion.\n\nCompared with the year-ago quarter, Nvidia earnings soared 593%, while sales saw a 206% spike. The period was also the second-straight quarter in which the chip leader reported triple-digit growth in both metrics.\n\nDemand from data centers was the chief reason. Nvidia's data-center sales jumped 279% from the year-earlier period to a record $14.51 billion. Data-center sales also increased 41% from the second quarter.\n\nWhen it filed its earnings report, Nvidia projected sales of $20 billion for the fourth quarter ending in January. That translates to 231% growth from the prior year, and came in ahead of analyst views for $17.96 billion.\n\nNvidia stock analysts now expect 239% growth in per-share earnings to $11.22 for fiscal 2024, which ends this month. After that, Wall Street sees profit growth sharply decelerating to 69% in fiscal 2025.\n\nAI Products Drive Growth\n\nNvidia has earned a reputation for being a trailblazer. The company was an early pioneer in the graphics processors that many say drastically improved computer gaming. Along with gaming, Nvidia chips now are used in such industries as health care, automobiles and robotics.\n\nIn March, generative AI took a leap with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to the company, Nvidia's AI-capable supercomputer paved the way for the \"iPhone moment of AI.\"\n\nThat helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales and four quarters of tapering earnings. But then the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the two most recent quarters.\n\nTop Ratings For Nvidia\n\nNvidia stock shows exceptional technical strength and boasts a best-possible score of 99 on both its Composite Rating and EPS Rating. Its Relative Strength Rating of 98 also shows that it outperforms the vast majority of stocks in the Investor's Business Daily database.\n\nNvidia also is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that led the 2023 stock rally. The other stocks are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN). Some of these tech titans are customers that rely on Nvidia's advanced chips. It is also one of the \"Magnificent Seven of 2024.\"\n\nNvidia stock currently ranks first in the fabless semiconductor group, which holds 16th place among IBD's 197 industry groups. The AI stock frequently appears on the IBD 50, IBD Sector Leaders and Tech Leaders lists. Further, the stock is on IBD Leaderboard.\n\nIn November, Nvidia stock jumped 15% and outperformed the Nasdaq's 10.70% gain. But in December, it finished up 6%, just above the Nasdaq's 5.5% advance for the month.\n\nIs Nvidia A Stock A Buy?\n\nDespite the stock's surge, its Accumulation/Distribution Rating for Nvidia stock is C+. That shows that interest among institutional buyers in the last 13 weeks is weaker.\n\nOverall worldwide AI chip revenue will grow 26% from $53.4 billion in 2023 to $67.1 billion in 2024, according to a recent report from research firm Gartner. That is set to double by 2027 to $119 billion\n\nNvidia stock is not a buy right now. Shares are extended from a buy zone that originated from a flat base's 505.48 entry.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nSee Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point\n\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSmith Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners?

Year-to-date, shares of the magnificent seven member have declined by almost 20% and nearly 15% over the previous three months.\n\nIt’s a rare underperformance for the company as it has historically outperformed the overall market. However, that hasn’t been the case, as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, a benchmark for the market, is up over 5% year-to-date. The technology sector, Invesco QQQ ETF QQQ, also increased by over 5% during the same period.\n\nHowever, might the tide be turning for shares of Tesla after the stock posted a green week last week, closing up over 3%? After beginning the week flat and holding above prior support, the stock rallied into the end of the week to post a modest gain. The recent action in Tesla, together with the overall market trading near all-time highs, beckons the question: Has Tesla bottomed, and is now the time to buy?\n\nLet’s take a closer look.\n\nTesla’s recent earnings and current valuation\n\nTesla released its quarterly earnings data on January 24th, 2024, reporting $0.71 per share per quarter, falling short of analysts' consensus estimates of $0.75 by $0.04. Despite revenues of $25.17 billion during the quarter, slightly below analyst predictions of $25.64 billion, the company's quarterly revenue saw a 3.5% increase compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nWith a current price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 46 and $4.31 earnings per share over the last year, Tesla anticipates earnings growth of 36.09% in the upcoming year, from $2.66 to $3.62 per share. Although Tesla has not confirmed its next earnings release date, it's estimated to be on Wednesday, April 17th, 2024, based on the previous year's reports.\n\nFrom a fundamental point of view, one might argue that Tesla is overvalued, with a P/E of 46 and a forward P/E of 47. However, from a technical perspective, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 49.15 places it close to oversold territory, making it a prime candidate for a leg up.\n\nSentiment remains mixed for Tesla\n\nDespite possessing a cult-like following and being one of the most searched-for stocks, the sentiment surrounding Tesla remains bearish to mixed.\n\nTesla is among the most downgraded and lowest-rated stocks, according to a list of publicly traded companies that analysts have downgraded most frequently in the past ninety days.\n\nBased on thirty-four analyst ratings, Tesla has a consensus Hold rating. That rating has remained steady over the previous year, during which analysts placing Tesla as a Buy decreased from twenty to the current nine. The analyst’s consensus price target on the stock is $219.89, which forecasts a nearly 10% upside. While the two most recent analyst actions on the stock have not been favorable, both price targets are above the previous close for the stock.\n\nOn February 5, Piper Sandler lowered its target for Tesla from $295 to $225. Daiwa Capital Markets downgraded the stock the following day and reduced its target from $245 to $195.\n\nSupport has been confirmed\n\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, support has been confirmed in the short term, giving traders and investors a level against which to trade. After pulling into a previous support zone near $180 two weeks ago, the stock found support and buyers and has recently taken out the prior pivot high from earlier in the year. As a result, if the stock can continue to base above previous support and confirm higher lows, a move toward its 200-day Simple Moving Average might be the next target for a leg higher, currently near $233. With a Beta of 2.43, short-term volatility and significant outperformance relative to the market can be expected if a trend develops in Tesla."}

Most see consensus falling and AI ‘off-the-table’ for now.\"\n\nJonas said his “read of the room” from the lunch, a semi-regular gathering Morgan Stanley holds for its institutional clients, revealed that “everyone felt the stock would underperform over 6 months” and almost everyone felt the stock would underperform over the next year. Tesla stock is down a whopping 25% year to date.\n\nJonas cited several reasons for the overall bearishness among clients, one of the biggest being AI and Tesla's exclusion from tech’s AI-related run-up.\n\n“[Tesla CEO] Elon Musk is seen as ‘sidelining’ Tesla from the AI theme for 2024, allowing investors to focus on the deteriorating EV demand narrative,” Jonas wrote.\n\nThis photo taken on Feb. 8, 2024, shows a Tesla Cybertruck at the 2024 Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place in Chicago. (Joel Lerner/Xinhua via Getty Images) (Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images) More\n\nThis is likely fallout from a string of tweets from Elon Musk in mid-January in which he wrote that he would be “uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.” Many saw this as Musk threatening to siphon off AI efforts into separate companies, thus depriving Tesla of gains made in its AI efforts, and also Musk demanding more compensation in the form of stock grants from the Tesla board.\n\nJonas has written glowingly in the past about Tesla’s AI and supercomputing prowess and has modeled Tesla’s long-term growth using these factors. Jonas noted Morgan Stanley’s valuation of Tesla’s core auto business represents just 22% of the firm’s $345 price target, with Tesla’s other plays like AI, fleet network services and cloud, robotics, software (full self-driving), and supercomputing making up the rest.\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, despite the automaker’s efforts in the space (such as using AI to train its full self-driving software), Jonas thinks AI sentiment is so bad at the company that Tesla is “not just ‘excluded’ from the AI trade … but actually on the other side of the AI trade.” The recent performance of the “Magnificent Six” stocks proves that out.\n\nAnother big concern from investors was the possibility of little to no revenue growth — something that seemed unheard of given Tesla’s performance over the years.\n\nElon Musk addresses the European Jewish Association's conference in Krakow, Poland, on Monday, Jan. 22, 2024. (Czarek Sokolowski/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“Investors questioned whether there was a possibility that Tesla may not grow volume vs the Q4 run-rate of 2 [million] units,\" Jonas wrote. “For a name where its management team was recently targeting 50% top line CAGR (compound annual growth rate) [in annual deliveries], the change in sentiment on growth was not lost on the group.”\n\nIndeed, while Tesla did report 484,507 deliveries in Q4, representing an all-time record quarter for Tesla, management did warn that the \"vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023.\" Tesla reported 2023 vehicle deliveries grew 38% to 1.81 million, while production grew 35% to 1.85 million.\n\nDespite the overall tone at the lunch, Jonas reiterated Morgan Stanley’s Overweight rating and $345 price target on the stock, representing an 80% upside for shares from current levels. In order to deliver that kind of upside, however, Tesla will have to overcome issues not just facing EV makers but the larger auto sector too, such as higher interest rates, higher costs, and supply gluts.\n\n“We acknowledge FY24 will be a challenging year for the global auto industry, which is reflected in our estimates,\" he said.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

That’s more than 8% lower than it was last week. The cheaper Model Y rear-wheel drive version got a discount of 4%.\n\nModel Y and Model 3 prices this past week were reduced between 3% and 6% in China. The base version of the Model Y crossover vehicle in China now starts at about $36,000, down from about $37.000. The base Model 3 starts at about $34,500, down from $36,500.\n\nShares dropped 3.7% after the Chinese price cuts. Telsa stock was down 1.5% in premarket trading Wednesday while S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite futures were down 0.4% and 0.4%, respectively.\n\nPrice cuts mean lower profit margins. Tesla cut prices around the world last year to stay competitive with rivals and to compensate for higher interest rates increasing the cost of car financing. Operating profit margins in 2023 should come in under 10%, down roughly 7 percentage points year over year.\n\nChina is the largest market for new cars and new EVs in the world, but its also the most competitive market with many auto makers vying for EV share. Future Fund Active ETF co-founder Gary Black hoped that Chinese price cuts wouldn’t spread to the rest of the world. That hasn’t been the case though.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\n“Tesla management still does not see that cutting [EV] prices and inventory discounts by the same amount is value destructive,” said Black. “Tesla is training its customers to wait for a deal.”\n\nThe silver lining, for Black, is that the cuts will cost only 15 cents of lost earnings per share. Black projects earnings of $3.75 a share for Tesla in 2024.\n\nTelsa may be sacrificing margin to protect market share. In Germany, the competition is coming mainly from Volkswagen, the country’s biggest auto maker. VW overtook Tesla’s market share in the country last year.\n\nEarlier this week, BMW Chief Financial Officer Walter Mertl said the German auto maker has passed the tipping point for combustion-engine vehicle sales and now generates most sales growth from electric cars, Reuters reported, citing a roundtable conversation.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nBMW sold about 376,000 battery-electric vehicles in 2023, up almost 75% year over year. It sold about 2.2 million nonelectric vehicles, roughly flat with 2022.\n\nIn China, the biggest rival is BYD, which delivered more all-electric vehicles than Tesla in the fourth quarter for the first time.\n\nTesla stock has dropped 12% since Jan. 1. It’s still up 70% over the past 12 months."}

Its earnings missed expectations and its shares experienced the biggest drop in over a year. The U.S. electric vehicle giant has been a big investor darling, with its shares doubling in 2023, but the company itself warned of a slowdown in 2024. Kingsley Jones, CIO and founder of boutique advisory firm Jevons Global, isn’t optimistic on the stock right now, thanks to rising competition from Chinese EV makers. He told CNBC Pro Talks on Thursday, “Unless Tesla can really expand their model range … and get their price down … then I think they are going to have a bit of a problem here because China’s going to be really eating away at their market opportunity outside of the U.S.” Tesla will probably face margin pressure in the United States if it doesn’t get both its prices and costs down, Jones added. Prefer BYD to Tesla Jones prefers Tesla’s Chinese EV rival BYD , which he says is his top EV pick. The stock has attractive valuations for its growth rate, Jones said. “This company is vertically integrated, and they control so much of their supply chain, including the batteries. So we think they’re pretty well positioned going forward,” he said. “I haven’t seen anything that would suggest to me that they don’t have sales momentum, business momentum, new model release momentum, and indeed, now export momentum,” Jones said. Earlier in January, data from both companies showed BYD dethroned Tesla in the fourth quarter as the top EV maker globally, and also surpassed Tesla’s production for a second straight year in 2023. BYD is now expanding aggressively overseas after dominating its domestic market in China. Like Tesla, it’s going beyond selling cars and manufacturing its own batteries and other components to stay competitive. Jones’ final word: “I’m a Tesla owner, I don’t own the stock. I own BYD instead, the stock – not the car. So I think that says everything in a way.” Two other EV alternatives Another EV company that Jones likes is Volvo Trucks, a unit under Swedish automaker Volvo . “The reason we like [electric] trucks is that it’s the area where Western manufacturers are still pretty strong,” he said. Volvo has a “very good” truck business, he said, adding: “In particular, they’re making a good transition in terms of electric trucks. So they’re probably one of the leaders in electric trucks worldwide.” He likes its “good business mix” of having sustainable biodiesel trucks and electric and fuel cell ones, he said. Finally, Jones flagged Chinese EV maker Nio as being “one of the leaders” in the highly competitive Chinese EV industry.

Of our $380 price target, our valuation of the “core” auto business is $86/share, leaving 77% of our target derived by network services, mobility, third-party battery/full self-driving licensing, energy, and insurance.\n\nWe receive significant pushback from our clients for including nonauto revenue streams in our valuation. Our Overweight thesis is highly dependent upon these business lines becoming far greater drivers of earnings with clear milestones/proof points backed by accompanying financial disclosure.\n\nFrom a fiscal-2023 base, we forecast Tesla earnings per share grow at a 27% compound annual growth rate through fiscal 2030, achieving $5/share in late fiscal 2025, $10/share in late fiscal 2027, and $15/share by mid fiscal 2029. While it’s important to factor in near-term/real-time headwinds into fiscal 2024, we believe it is also important and reasonable to consider the long-term potential of the products and services being commercialized by the company.\n\nWalmart • WMT-NYSE\n\nOutperform • Price $156.41 on Dec. 27\n\nby TD Cowen\n\nWe hosted meetings with Walmart’s senior vice president and head of investor relations, Stephanie Wissink, who has an extensive background in strategy, finance, marketing, and public markets analysis. We are most excited by Walmart’s advancements as a technology company—which drives higher margin growth through both digital advertising (Walmart Connect) and marketplaces (we estimate 70%-plus margins in both businesses).\n\nFurthermore, we model 20% digital advertising growth next year. We also believe that the company is well positioned to achieve management’s multiyear 4% net sales growth algorithm, composed of: 2% Walmart U.S. and Sam’s Club, 1% international, and 1% alternative value streams such as marketplace and digital advertising. Price target: $188.\n\nHarmonic • HLIT-Nasdaq\n\nBuy • Price $12.55 on Dec. 28\n\nby Rosenblatt Securities\n\nAn activist investor, Ancora Advisors, a top 10 holder, announced a campaign urging the company to quickly divest the video business and use the proceeds for a stepped up buyback. Consistent with Ancora’s demands, we believe that a sale of the video business could be announced in conjunction with fourth-quarter earnings, if not before.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nWe also believe that management plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds to buy back stock. On a conservative basis, we believe that the video business is worth $125 million to $150 million. The sale of the video business will transform Harmonic into a pure play on next-generation broadband.\n\nBy our numbers, the revenue growth rate of the company from 2022 through 2025 more than doubles from 13% to 27%, and the growth rate of adjusted Ebitda goes from 27% to 46%, making a clear argument for multiple expansion. Price target: $18.\n\nSpotify Technology • SPOT-NYSE\n\nBuy • Price $188.71 on Dec. 21\n\nby Guggenheim\n\nWe are refining our 2024 quarterly Spotify model to reflect seasonality of subscriber additions and gross margin expansion. Our overall operating and financial assumptions for full-year 2024 are largely unchanged, while we trim our first-quarter 2024 gross margin estimate to 26.2% to better account for typical trends.\n\nWe have lowered our fourth-quarter 2023 and first-half 2024 free-cash-flow estimates to better reflect cash-related severance charges related to recently announced head-count reductions. We expect a minimum positive impact to annual operating profit of 320 million to 350 million euros related to announced staffing changes and expect the company to remain diligently focused on efficient operations and a path to stronger profit and free-cash-flow growth. This is reflected in our above-consensus operating profit forecasts for 2024 and beyond. Price target: $220.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nAvista • AVA-NYSE\n\nBuy • Price $35.87 on Dec. 29\n\nby Siebert Williams Shank\n\nShares of Avista [an electricity and natural-gas utility] continue to be perplexing, as they have declined 19.1% year to date. While 2023 earnings have been constrained somewhat by poor hydroelectric conditions, we are still expecting EPS growth of roughly 10% in 2023 and 12% in 2024. Recent regulatory outcomes in all key jurisdictions bode well for the company’s 2024 earnings.\n\nAt an indicated dividend yield of 5.13%, Avista shares are trading at relative yield premiums to bonds and peer utility stocks that appear excessive. The company’s fundamental backdrop has been steadily improving, and we expect 2024 to represent significant opportunity for better momentum. Price target: $50.\n\nCarMax • KMX-NYSE\n\nUnderweight • Price $78.55 on Dec. 23\n\nby J.P.Morgan\n\nCarMax’s fiscal third-quarter results were an upside surprise, driven by a larger-than-expected reduction in loss allowance within the CarMax auto finance business, while the core retail operation was also slightly better than JPM estimates.\n\nWe had expected loss reserves to move lower gradually through calendar 2025-26, though we now pull forward the trajectory in our estimates, driving our CAF assumptions higher.\n\nOur fiscal-2026/calendar-2025 estimates remain unchanged as core retail profit assumptions move lower. Our fiscal fourth quarter/fiscal 2025/fiscal 2026 EPS are now $0.45/$3.25/$4.10, versus $0.50/$3.05/$4.10 prior. Our December 2024 end price target remains unchanged at $60."}

Come to think of it, the shares have had quite a couple of years. Now Wall Street’s biggest bull laid out his thinking for the coming year.\n\nTesla stock dropped 65% in 2022. Through midday trading Wednesday, with a couple of trading days left in 2023, shares have surged more than 110%. Volatility like that makes predicting the future tough. Wall Street will try, though.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas sees 2024 as “another volatile, idiosyncratic year.” Idiosyncratic, in this instance, appears to mean that things other than cars will drive the stock. There is no new high-volume product. The new Cybertruck will ship fewer than 100,000 units, according to Wall Street estimates. There is also more electric-vehicle competition trying to chip away at Tesla’s market share. The all-electric Chevy Blazer, for instance, will ship more volume, and General Motors will also start selling the more affordable all-electric Chevy Equinox.\n\nThat sounds bearish, but automotive and EV fundamentals don’t always directly translate into what happens to Tesla stock. “If 12 months ago I told you that Tesla’s 2024 forward consensus earnings-per-share estimates would be revised down by nearly 50%, would you have predicted the stock would nearly double?” asked Jonas in a research report published Tuesday evening. “Well, that’s precisely what has happened.”\n\nOther things can drive Tesla shares. For 2024, Jonas recommends a few things including keeping an eye on the Tesla robot Optimus which is being designed to complete repetitive, dangerous, and unattractive tasks. Then there is A.I. Tesla’s Dojo computing platform which it uses to train its autonomous driving features might find nonautomotive endmarkets. “The same forces that have driven Amazon Web Services to reach 70% of Amazon’s total [operating profit] can work at Tesla,” added Jonas. Third, he also sees potential for Tesla to supply other car markers battery or autonomous driving technologies. Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted in July that a major auto maker was thinking of licensing Tesla’s self-driving tech.\n\nRobot progress, new AI business, and self-driving licensing agreements are three things that can drive the stock. It’s optimistic to think all three will happen in 2024, and Jonas is a Tesla bull, rating shares Buy with a $380 price target.\n\nHe values the car business at $86 a share based on selling 7.4 million cars in 2030. Tesla is expected to sell about 1.8 million cars in 2023. He values a self-driving robotaxi business at $82 a share. The software business, which is also some self-driving technology sold to Tesla drivers, is valued at $115 a share. Tesla’s energy business, which includes solar roofs and battery storage, is worth about $48 a share, according to Jonas. The rest of the value is made up of selling insurance and technologies to other car companies.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nJonas has the highest target price on Wall Street, according to FactSet. The top five price targets among major brokers value Tesla stock at about $340 a share, implying a market capitalization of about $1.1 trillion. The bottom five price targets among major brokers average roughly $120 a share, implying a market capitalization of about $380 billion.\n\nThe $220 bull-bear spread is about 85% of the current stock price. It’s also about $700 billion worth of market capitalization based on Tesla’s roughly 3.2 billion shares outstanding. That’s large. The gap between top and bottom price targets for Microsoft is about $100 a share, or less than 30% of the current price of the shares. That Microsoft gap is also worth roughly $750 billion in market value based on Microsoft’s roughly 7.5 billion shares outstanding.\n\nWall Street, it appears, has a tougher time valuing the EV leader than it does the established software giant.\n\nJonas’ report might be helping shares on Wednesday. Tesla stock is up 2.1% in midday trading while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are up 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue"}

Chinese registration data show that Tesla delivered some 18,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles this past week, bringing the quarter-to-date total to some 155,000 units with one week to go, according to Citi analyst Jeff Chung.\n\nThat excludes the more expensive Model S and X, which typically account for about 3% to 5% of overall sales. The best quarter Tesla has ever had in China was about 156,000 units delivered in the second quarter of 2023. Tesla should surpass that amount with only two of its four models selling in China.\n\nRecord Chinese sales give investors some confidence that the overall number reported on Jan. 2 will be a record.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThe refreshed Model 3 is also selling well. Tesla has sold about 30,000 of its updated Model 3s in China so far in the fourth quarter. That is up from about 23,000 sold in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nTuesday’s post-Christmas rise follows a pattern for Tesla stock. Shares have gained 10 of the 14 post-Christmas sessions since Tesla became a publicly traded company in 2010.\n\nThe day after Christmas also tends to be volatile. The stock moves an average of 4%, up or down, in the first session following Christmas. The average move is a loss of 0.1% because while gains outnumber losses, the down days are severe. Tesla stock dropped 11% the day after Christmas in 2022 as investors worried about rising interest rates and CEO Elon Musk’s ownership of Twitter, now known as X.\n\nTesla stock finished 2022 down some 65% but through midday on Tuesday, the shares were up about 108% so far in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue"}

The smart move for investors is to digest the reasons for the gains while keeping an eye on levels where the rally could stall.\n\nShares were up 2% in early trading, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 0.8% and 1%, respectively.\n\nThere isn’t a lot of news to pin the gains on. Reuters reported External link on Thursday that Tesla faces a recall of some Model S and X vehicles in Norway. That isn’t good news, but the S and X are lower-volume vehicles.\n\nIn any case, recalls typically don’t matter for auto maker stocks. Millions of vehicles are recalled each year to keep cars on roads safe . The costs involved rarely rise to the level where investors should be concerned.\n\nWednesday evening, Toyota recalled about 1 million vehicles for an air bag issue. And Honda just recalled 2.5 million vehicles for a fuel-pump problem. That helps put into context the fact that Tesla recently recalled some two million vehicles to update warnings given to people using the company’s driver-assistance features.\n\nThe market deserves some of the credit for the latest gain as well. Tesla stock is typically more volatile than the Nasdaq, so when the index rises, it isn’t uncommon for Tesla to rise a little more.\n\nCathie Wood is behind part of the gain. Her ARK Invest bought about 111,000 shares of Tesla stock in two funds on Wednesday. Wood is a longtime Tesla bull and the stock is the second-largest position in the ARK Innovation ETF. Coinbase is the exchange-traded fund’s biggest holding.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nInvestors may also still be digesting Chinese data that show Tesla is on pace for a record quarter of deliveries. Investors expect some 475,000 vehicles to be delivered globally in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe stock charts are helping as well. They also offer a clue about where Tesla stock is going.\n\n”A short-term breakout occurred last week for Tesla, which has reversed its downtrend back to July,” says Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton External link . “Resistance remains around $295, which could become relevant in Q1.”\n\nAlmost $300 a share would be welcomed by investors, given that the stock was at about $250 on Thursday morning. There might be one more step before Tesla shares head back to that level.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\n“A key level to get through now would be the 61.8% retracement of the entire July to October decline, which is near $257,” adds CappThesis founder Frank Cappelleri External link .\n\nTesla stock traded at almost $300 a share in July and traded below $200 at the end of October. Getting most of a significant decline back is something traders watch for before jumping back in.\n\nStockton and Cappelleri are so-called technical stock market analysts who use chart patterns for clues about investor sentiment and where stocks can go over the short- and medium-term. A lot of information is conveyed by how any stock is trading.\n\nTo be sure there are some headwinds. Wall Street has been cutting Tesla delivery estimates for 2024. Analysts now project about 2.1 million units, according to FactSet, down from 2.3 million units a few weeks ago. Tesla is offering bigger sales incentives, too. Tesla is now offering six months of free charging on its network and a few thousand dollars off Model 3 and Y vehicles in inventory.\n\nLower prices and lower volumes aren’t good things. But for now, investors think all the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThe next big piece of fundamental data to watch will be fourth-quarter deliveries.

At least not when the Fed is spreading Christmas cheer by hinting at interest-rate cuts in the coming year.\n\nTesla stock was up almost 5% in late trading Thursday, sitting above $250 a share. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were both close to flat.\n\nIt has been quite a wild ride for Tesla stock. Shares were having a lousy midweek trading session on Wednesday as a large recall and potential loss of the Federal tax credit on some Model 3 versions weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nBarron’s has written repeatedly that recalls don’t matter all that much for car stocks. Tesla recalled 2 million vehicles to update warning systems on autonomous driving features. Fixing the problem will cost little, the autonomous driving features still work, and they will eventually be widely adopted in the industry. Even NHTSA, the agency that manages recalls, agrees with those sentiments.\n\nThe tax-credit changes are more problematic. Investors were aware that many EVs stood to lose some of the $7,500 tax credit in 2024. The U.S. government doesn’t want to subsidize EVs with Chinese batteries, and China remains the largest EV battery maker on the planet, supplying Tesla and many other auto makers. Still, losing all of the $7,500 credit, as Tesla now expects on two versions of the Model 3, was a surprise.\n\nThat still affects a only small portion of Tesla’s lineup, however. The biggest issue from the credit changes might be the relative pricing impact. A performance Model 3 is now less than a long-range Model 3, adjusted for the credit.\n\nWhatever the financial realities of the credit and the recall for Tesla are, investors weren’t happy on Wednesday. Tesla stock was down almost 4% at one point. Then the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell, decided to hold interest rates steady. What’s more, the Fed dot plot showed that three or four rate cuts are likely for 2024.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite surged. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record. All car stocks rallied. General Motors shares were up about 9% from the depths of Wednesday into late trading on Thursday. Ford Motor stock gained about 11%. Tesla shares added 8%.\n\nLower rates matter for the car industry. They mean lower car payments for customers. The impact higher rates have on car demand is something Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been lamenting for months.\n\nThat’s one reason the car stocks went up, but it’s hard for any stock to go down when the entire market is rallying. Over any short period, a significant percentage of any stock’s return is simply based on what the market does.\n\nThat’s why traders and portfolio managers keep track of a stock’s beta. That is a number that essentially describes how a stock typically performs relative to the market.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nOver the past year, Tesla’s beta versus the S&P 500 is about two. That means, very roughly, that a 1% jump in the S&P should produce a 2% jump in Tesla stock.\n\nThe S&P gained roughly 1.5% over the past couple of trading days. Tesla stock would be expected to be up about 3% all else being equal. Shares ended up gaining about 5.5%. The extra 2.5% can be explained by the impact of lower rates on car stocks.\n\nWhat’s next for Tesla shares? The recent jump has left Tesla stock right in the middle of its trading range over the past six months. Investors are waiting for something truly new to happen. That could be fourth-quarter deliveries, or earnings, or lower rates.\n\nThe first two will impact Tesla stock no matter what the market does. Lower rates, meanwhile, will help most stocks, Tesla among them."}

This time has also come to mean something for Tesla investors: wondering about Elon Musk’s potential sales of Tesla stock.\n\nTo be clear, there is no reason to expect sales this year, but if things don’t stabilize at X, Musk might have to break a promise he made about his Tesla sales in 2022.\n\nThis isn’t a merry topic for investors. Stock sales by key executives always make shareholders nervous. What’s more, Musk owns a lot of Tesla stock. He has sold a lot from time to time, too.\n\nMusk sold billions of dollars in stock in late 2021, mainly to pay taxes while exercising expiring stock options, while debating the taxation of billionaires with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.).\n\nMusk sold billions of dollars of Tesla stock throughout 2022 to help fund the purchase of his social-media platform, once called Twitter and now named X. His last 2022 stock sale happened in November.\n\nLarge transactions move stock prices. In 2022, from April 14, when Musk tweeted “I made an offer” for Twitter, until late December, when he said he was done selling stock, Tesla shares fell more than 60%.\n\nStocks in general were falling at the time—the Nasdaq Composite lost more than 20% over the same span—but Tesla stock’s performance was significantly worse. Investors don’t like adding to positions if they know large stock sales are coming. Musk said he wouldn’t sell any more Tesla stock for at least 18 months in December 2022. In the three months following that pronouncement, Tesla stock rallied more than 50%.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nMusk’s December declaration also put the earliest potential sales of Tesla stock in June 2024. There isn’t any formal assurance that sales won’t happen before then. It depends, to some extent, on how X is performing.\n\nX and Tesla didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments about potential stock sales by Musk, or X financials.\n\nHow X is doing has become a key question for Tesla investors in recent weeks after several advertisers paused spending on the platform following a Nov. 16 report from progressive media watchdog Media Matters that showed advertiser content adjacent to anti-Semitic material. The report followed a controversial tweet from Musk about the conflict in Palestine.\n\nX is suing Media Matters, alleging the watchdog skewed data, making the issue seem worse than it is. Media Matters called the X suit “frivolous.” Musk has strenuously denied he is anti-Semitic, and said this past week that a lack of advertising on X could kill the company.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nWhen Musk bought the company, Twitter was generating about $1.2 billion in revenue each quarter. It was producing bottom-line profits, but wasn’t generating free cash flow, using about $100 million per quarter.\n\nMusk laid off about 80% of Twitter staff in 2022 after pointing out the company was losing $4 million a day. Results were close to break-even in April 2023, according to Musk. To make that math work with layoffs, revenue was likely down in the range of 30% to 40% year over year.\n\nRevenue has continued to deteriorate according to a source who is invested in X. Musk also said in July that X’s cash flow was still negative. That, along with Musk’s contention that a lack of advertising could kill that platform, means losses could easily be in the range of $100 million to $200 million per quarter right now.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up The Barron's Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers. Preview Subscribed\n\nThat is only a rough guess. Losses could be much higher, or lower, depending on how severe the advertising has been.\n\nAll this doesn’t mean stock sales are imminent. X started life under Musk’s ownership with roughly $6 billion in cash. But he also added billions of dollars of long-term debt to the company’s balance sheet to finance the purchase External link .\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThat means significantly higher interest expenses, but most of the original cash should still be there. What’s more, Musk sold about $4 billion of Tesla stock in November 2022. Some of that could have been to help X.\n\nAll the numbers and projections mean that an early 2024 Tesla stock sale by Musk doesn’t look imminent. If X doesn’t recover, however, and requires billions of dollars to stabilize, sales of Tesla stock by Musk could move the share price again."}

Replacing them in the lexicon du jour is the Magnificent Seven Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\nX\n\nFrom GOOGL, AAPL and AMZN to META, MSFT, NVDA and TSLA, the Magnificent Seven stocks account for around half of the weighting of the Nasdaq.\n\nUnlike the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes are market-capitalization weighted.\n\nAs a result, the combined market caps of the Magnificent Seven stocks have a disproportional influence on the Nasdaq composite and Nasdaq 100.\n\nTo help address this issue, the Nasdaq rebalanced the index on July 24. That reduced the individual weighting of the Magnificent Seven stocks. But the rebalancing simply changed the total weighting of these seven megacaps from over 50% to nearly 50%.\n\nIn short, the Nasdaq 100 remains heavily concentrated on these megacap growth stocks. Resurgent gains by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and the other Magnificent Seven stocks boosted the tech-heavy index as a result.\n\nToward the end of last year, Nvidia stock, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google stock all launched breakouts.\n\nNvidia blasted out to yet another all-time high earlier this month before reporting another beat-and-raise quarter late Wednesday. Meta stock gapped up earlier this month to a record high of its own, holding those gains while trading in a tight range. The Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp parent recent encountered an epic boardroom shuffle.\n\nMeanwhile, after being trapped below its 50-day and 200-day lines, Tesla plunged over 12% on Jan. 25 on earnings, with analysts slamming Tesla's opaque guidance and \"train wreck\" earnings call. TSLA stock has also seen its 50-day moving average slide below its longer-term 200-day benchmark, a sign of technical weakness.\n\nNote that Microsoft has just eclipsed Apple stock in terms of market cap weighting on the Nasdaq. MSFT stock now accounts for 9.8% of the tech-heavy index, compared to 9.3% for the iPhone maker.\n\nYes, Nvidia Is One.

And when that state of mind changes – see Tesla.\n\nNvidia is special because the dollars are suddenly so huge – a hair over $2 trillion at the open on Friday, and just a little below $2 trillion at the close. Over the past 12 months, market cap has spiked by $1.46 trillion, including the biggest-ever-for-any-stock one-day spike of $277 billion on Thursday, on exceeding revenue expectations by $2 billion.\n\nThere are other charts that look even wilder because these are crazy times, and all kinds of stuff has been spiking and in crazy ways. And Tesla’s chart used to look like this too, before the shares plunged 70% in 2022. Crazy spikes like this generally don’t lead to a permanently high plateau. But Nvidia is now huge, and it’s floating on top of a mindboggling AI-mania.\n\nNvidia has always been a volatile stock because something always derails the latest GPU-to-the-moon narrative. For example, between November 2020 and October 2022, Nvidia shares plunged by 65%, barely dodging our Imploded Stocks pantheon (minimum requirement: -70% from high). And now the numbers are much bigger. We show the market cap in the chart because the dollars are now so huge that they really matter for the overall market:\n\nThe utter mania around generative AI that has suddenly gripped corporate America led to an explosion in sales of high-dollar and high-margin systems of GPUs for Nvidia.\n\nJust about every major company is touting its progress with AI – for now, mostly just spending money on it – and periodically there are hilarious stories about generative AI’s not so intelligent work. I mean, can you fire AI if it screws up badly enough? Or is that suddenly a human’s fault?\n\nThe amounts of money thrown at generative AI from all directions are just vast. And Nvidia is getting its share of the pie. Nvidia’s revenues might hit $100 billion in 2024, knock on wood, up from $27 billion in 2022. And it just might, or might not, surpass Tesla’s revenues, which were already $97 billion in 2023.\n\nThese price spikes are a state of mind: See Tesla.\n\nSo we just accidently remembered that Tesla’s stock too went through these WTF spikes until it hit $414.50 on November 4, 2021, and then plunged 70% over the following year and was inducted into our pantheon of Imploded Stocks in December 2022, when its shares hit $123, after which they dropped some more. These spikes unwind brutally.\n\nThen came the big rally through mid-July 2023, and then the shares spiraled down again, and today they’re down 54% from the peak in November 2021, and they’re still overvalued though Tesla has become a much bigger and a much more successful automaker since the all-time high in November 2021.\n\nSince that all-time high, Tesla has become very profitable. Its Model Y has become the #1 best-selling model in the world, blowing away Toyota’s Corolla, and it has become the #2 best-selling model in the US, just behind Ford’s F-series truck. And since the all-time high, Tesla opened two new factories, one in Germany and one in Texas, and production and deliveries have soared, and it’s eating market share of the legacy automakers in big gulps, and despite its already substantial size, its global deliveries jumped by 38% in 2023.\n\nAnd yet, over those two years when Tesla’s business continued to boom, Tesla’s market cap plunged by over $600 billion. Turns out, these WTF spikes are a state of mind. And when that state of mind changes, the spikes unwind.\n\nHow long will the Nvidia narrative last?\n\nWill Nvidia have a monopoly on AI-suitable GPU systems? Will no one figure out how to make something competitive and sell it a lower price? And will Meta, a gigantic customer of Nvidia’s GPU systems, suddenly discover that it has all the GPUs it’ll need, just like it had suddenly discovered that it had way too much office space and way too many employees? Companies are kind of weird in what they suddenly discover. All kinds of things can change that might rattle that overstretched state of mind – same thing that Tesla went through to get off its WTF spike.\n\nEnjoy reading WOLF STREET and want to support it?

Now investors have all but thrown in the towel on the shares.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAll it took was a fresh dose of reality from the two companies this week around cooling demand for EVs. Rivian, which makes electric pickups, SUVs and delivery vans and counts Amazon.com Inc. as its top shareholder, said its production will stay flat at last year’s levels. It also announced plans to shrink its workforce again. Lucid, majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, projected only a slight increase in output over 2023. Both forecasts fell far short of analysts’ expectations.\n\nFor investors, the sense of gloom has been building since October, when Tesla Inc. warned of sagging interest in EVs. Though shares of the EV giant have fared poorly since then, losing around 20% and massively underperforming the broader market, the impact on smaller rivals like Rivian and Lucid has been nothing short of disastrous.\n\n“If you are a hyper-growth company in what is seen as a disruptive industry and you are not growing your topline, you are in trouble,” said David Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments. “Having an anchor investor like Amazon or the Saudis gives them a longer runway from a capital perspective, but their growth will still be slower and margins thinner than what was once expected.”\n\nRead more: Tesla Gets a $94 Billion Reality Check as EV Winter Sets In\n\nShares of Irvine, California-based Rivian are down by about 44% since Tesla’s October warning — the first in a series of grim outlooks from global EV-makers and suppliers — and closed Friday at a record low. Newark, California-based Lucid has dropped some 33% in the same period, and isn’t far above its own nadir.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, had it not been for their wealthy backers — Amazon has a 17% stake in Rivian, and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund holds roughly 60% of Lucid, data compiled by Bloomberg show — the stocks could be looking far uglier.\n\n“The presence of these names is a comfort to investors and a cushion to the price,” Mazza said. “If these stocks were just relying on the EV hype, then they will be down much worse.”\n\nAmazon in an emailed statement said that the recent results from Rivian don’t change anything about the e-commerce company’s “existing investment, collaboration, or order size and timing.” Rivian has a deal with Amazon to sell it 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s PIF didn’t respond to an email seeking comment outside of the fund’s regular business hours on Friday.\n\n‘Alarm Bells’\n\nOverall, the biggest concern is that these cash-burning, unprofitable companies will struggle to sell cars at a time when even industry-leader Tesla — by far the biggest seller in the US market — is cutting prices to boost demand. And while Tesla’s profits and large-scale production allow it to compete by lowering prices, Rivian and Lucid have neither of those advantages.\n\n“For these car manufacturers, investors want to see demand,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. Rivian’s latest results suggest it will take several quarters to emerge from its production stoppage with a leaner cost structure and a redesigned platform, he said.\n\n“In the meantime, I think skeptics will be scrutinizing the cash balance and ringing alarm bells,” Wagner said. “So if there is no multiple expansion and no growth — what else is the stock supposed to do?”\n\nBoth Rivian and Lucid are now worth a fraction of the prices they fetched at their public-market debuts in 2021. Rivian’s market value is around $9.6 billion, and Lucid’s is about $6.9 billion. That’s a long way down from their $153 billion and $91 billion valuation peaks, respectively, in 2021.\n\nWall Street analysts are losing confidence as well. Analysts’ average 12-month price targets for Rivian and Lucid fell nearly 20% just this week.

Shares in BYD have also tumbled by about 12% this year, to be fair.\n\nTesla's stock slide has erased about $188 billion from its valuation this year, according to Business Insider's calculations. The stock closed at just under $192, leaving it worth just over $600 billion at the close of trading Friday.\n\nRoth MKM analyst Craig Irwin has deemed Tesla \"egregiously overvalued\" and put a $85 target price on its shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's worth noting that the stock is about where it was this time last year. And even though Tesla's value has more than halved since its peak the shares are still up almost 900% over the past five years.\n\nNevertheless the 2024 wipeout has put Tesla's place in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of high-flying Big Tech stocks at risk. It's now worth considerably less than Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly as well as Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta.\n\nMusk's own wealth is closely tied to his 21% stake in Tesla — and his personal fortune has dropped about $21 billion this year as a result of the EV maker's stock-market struggles, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Before you start feeling too sorry for Musk, though, he's still worth $208 billion.\n\nShareholders have also had to contend with a Wall Street Journal report last month that said that some executives and board members were concerned about Musk's use of substances including LSD, cocaine, and ketamine. He's denied those claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA slightly more youthful Elon Musk at a Tesla launch. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nDelaware pay ruling\n\nTo add insult to injury, a Delaware judge also ruled against Musk's $55 billion Tesla pay package last month.\n\nMusk doesn't get a salary for his work as Tesla's CEO. Instead, his pay is tied to the company's growth.\n\nThe ruling in Delaware could threaten his title as the world's richest person , given that most of his wealth is tied to his equity in Tesla.\n\nSince the ruling, Musk has slammed Delaware as a place to do business and pledged to call a shareholder vote to transfer the EV maker's incorporation to Texas. And one of his other companies, SpaceX, has reportedly filed to relocate its business incorporation to the Lone Star state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nX's advertiser exodus\n\nMusk has also had to contend with issues of his own making at X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter that's seemingly been in a neverending state of crisis since he took control in October 2022.\n\nAdvertisers have started to pull away from the platform in response to Musk doubling down on comments widely perceived as antisemitic and then telling big-name sponsors to get lost (in a slightly more blunt fashion) in November.\n\nAd spending dropped 54% to $1.89 billion in 2023, according to data from Insider Intelligence, leaving X struggling to sell slots to promote trending topics during the Super Bowl. The advertisers left on X are sometimes for AI \"undressing\" apps and dubious crypto services, BI previously reported.\n\nIn what seems like an effort to drum up advertiser interest, Musk this week sent this an X Ads post to his 173 million followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnag more customers with X Ads! @SnaggedDomains captured their target audience by experimenting with their X Ads campaigns, increasing traffic by 534% and form submissions by 1245%. Get expert help with X Ads and book a meeting today (US only): https://t.co/rkbH7mKNw2 pic.twitter.com/Lky2bRPhQl — Business (@XBusiness) February 21, 2024\n\nAsset manager Fidelity has repeatedly marked down the value of its stake in X since Musk took it over and now thinks the company is worth 71% less than the $44 billion he bought it for, per Axios. However, it did raise the valuation of its X holding by 11% last month, Axios reported.\n\nStarlink struggles\n\nA Ukrainian soldier sets up a Starlink satellite terminal in the Chernihiv region. NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nLastly, Musk's SpaceX has been caught up in a row about Russia's claimed use of its Starlink satellite internet terminals.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly claimed that Russian troops are using Starlink in their territory. Musk previously denied the accusations, but Kyiv said this week it was working with SpaceX to disable Russia's access.\n\nSpaceX also had to delay a launch on Tuesday, again delaying its moon-landing efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Houston firm Intuitive Machines beat it to the punch when its uncrewed Odysseus lander successfully landed on the lunar surface, becoming the first commercial spacecraft to do so."}

Just ask Tesla (TSLA). But as Meta Platforms (META) shows, the return of a prodigal stock can be glorious.\n\nX\n\nWhile Tesla struggles to correct its long slide off a string of downturns since 2021, Meta stock has now skyrocketed as much as 461% from its lows in November 2022 to another record it just hit Friday.\n\nThe Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp parent has set up a new launchpad for even more gains. Holding most of its surge from a gap-up on Q4 earnings, Meta stock traded sideways to form a three-weeks-tight pattern.\n\nThe top of that formation around 485.96 sets the buy point. After Meta gapped up past that entry in rising and above-average volume Thursday, the stock eased off its intraday highs Friday to close in buy range at 484.03.\n\nNote that a three-weeks-tight pattern is typically considered a place to add shares to an existing position rather than start a new one. The number of shares purchased for add-on buys should be less than for earlier positions to keep the average share price down.\n\nNvidia Delivers Another Beat-And-Raise Quarter Fueled By AI Chips\n\nMeta Vs. Tesla: A Tale Of Two Stocks\n\nTesla's recent turmoil does not mean the EV pioneer cannot rebound. It certainly can, and Wall Street forecasts for 2025 call for the company to recharge and deliver a spike to 38% earnings growth in 2025.\n\nBut a quick comparison of both the fundamentals and technical action in Meta and Tesla paints a clear picture.\n\nAfter a severe slump of its own from 2022 to early 2023, Meta has generated three straight quarters of accelerating earnings growth. In Q4, the Mark Zuckerberg-led social media giant posted earnings of $5.33 per share, a 203% jump over the prior-year quarter.\n\nTesla, on the other hand, has seen profits decelerate in three of the last four quarters. Earnings for the fourth quarter slowed 40% to 71 cents a share.\n\nRevenue for Tesla has declined over the last two quarters, sliding to just 3% year-over-year growth in Q4. Meanwhile, Meta continues to build on its growth trajectory. From 3% sales growth to $28.6 billion in Q1, Meta Platforms drove a 25% year-over-year gain to $40.1 billion in Q4.\n\nThe powerful action in the chart for Meta stock reflects that turnaround in the company's fundamentals. The reverse is true for the troubles in Tesla stock.\n\nMeta, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google Spur Demand From Top Funds\n\nInstitutional demand plays another key role in the Tesla vs. Meta stock story.\n\nAlong with Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet, Meta made this month's list of new buys by the best mutual funds. In fact, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia each took in over well over $1 billion from these top money managers. Tesla has not made this list since August.\n\nThe ratings for all the Magnificent Seven stocks further highlight the gap between Meta and Tesla. For example, while Meta joins Nvidia in sporting the highest-possible 99 Composite Rating, Tesla earns a lowly 43.\n\nThe up/volume ratio is another key measure of interest among investors. Where anything above 1.0 points to demand, Meta scores a 1.6, while Tesla rates 0.8.\n\nCompany Symbol Comp Rating EPS Rating RS Rating Ind Group RS SMR Rating A/D Rating Meta Platforms (META) 99 96 97 A+ A B+ Nvidia (NVDA) 99 99 98 A+ A C+ Amazon.com (AMZN) 98 82 93 A A B+ Alphabet (GOOGL) 94 98 81 A+ A D+ Microsoft (MSFT) 93 97 87 C- A C+ Apple (AAPL) 73 94 53 C- A C Tesla (TSLA) 43 69 22 B- B D+\n\nFollow Matthew Galgani on X (formerly Twitter) at @IBD_MGalgani.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nEV Evisceration: Elon Musk Says A Bankruptcy May Be Looming\n\nYes, Nvidia Is One.

TSLA shares edged down Friday.\n\nX\n\nTesla increased the price of its Model 3 Long Range in the U.S. by $250 Thursday, bringing the price to $47,740. Back on Feb. 10, Tesla announced limited-time discounts for Model Y variants.\n\nThe base Real Wheel Drive Model Y is getting a $1,000 discount, to $42,990, but the new owner must take delivery by Feb. 29. The All Wheel Drive Model Y also has been reduced by $1,000, to $47,990. The Model Y Performance was unchanged at $52,490. Model Y inventory is offered at much lower prices.\n\nAll of that is before federal tax credits of $7,500 for the Model Y.\n\nThe updated Model 3 is no longer eligible for federal tax credits due to stricter battery sourcing requirements. That means the Model 3 is often substantially more expensive than the Model Y.\n\nWhile the Tesla Model Y discounts officially end after Feb. 29, it's possible that they could be extended, or made permanent. Tesla typically ramps up incentives at the end of the quarter. On Feb. 8, Tesla revived an offer to let Full Self-Driving owners to transfer their FSD rights to a new Model 3, Y, S or X, with delivery taken by March 31.\n\nTroy Teslike, whose delivery estimates and Tesla data tracking are highly respected among retail Tesla investors, posted on X Friday that Tesla is \"trying to discourage people from ordering a Model 3 version they can't produce while there is plenty of Model Y inventory waiting for buyers.\"\n\nU.S. delivery dates for the updated Model 3 Long Range have been pushed back to April-May. That reflects in large part limited initial production at Tesla's Fremont plant.\n\nTesla Stock\n\nTesla stock dropped 2.8% to 191.97 during Friday's market action. On Thursday, TSLA shares angled 1.4% higher to 197.41 as EV startups Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) cratered on earnings and 2024 outlooks.\n\nTesla stock fell 3.87% on the week, breaking a string of three consecutive weekly gains.\n\nIn 2023 Tesla doubled, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, but shares have trended lower since late July. Tesla stock ranks eighth the 35 member IBD Auto Manufacturers industry group. The stock has a 43 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

The Magnificent Seven stocks are among the best stocks to buy and watch in the stock market today.\n\nX\n\nDue to their outsized market capitalizations, Magnificent Seven stocks hold a disproportionate influence on the market-cap weighted Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 indexes.\n\nFor an in-depth look at this issue, check out IBD's page on the Magnificent Seven weightings, market capitalizations and the companies' latest news stories.\n\nMagnificent Seven Stocks Performance Company Name Symbol 2023 YTD Performance Alphabet (GOOGL) +50% Amazon (AMZN) +79% Apple (AAPL) +52% Meta Platforms (META) +178% Microsoft (MSFT) +55% Nvidia (NVDA) +235% Tesla (TSLA) +106% Source: IBD Data As Of Dec. 15, 2023\n\nStock Market ETF Strategy And How To Invest\n\nAlphabet In Buy Range Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is holding above a 139.42 buy point in a cup with handle amid recent gains. Google stock lost 0.3% Friday. On Jan. 30, Alphabet reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped analyst estimates. But shares tumbled as the search giant's core advertising business slightly missed views. Google debuted its Gemini AI model on Dec. 6. However, the demo video displaying the AI's capabilities turned out to be edited, Bloomberg reported. Google admitted the demo was created using still image frames from the footage with additional prompts via text, as well as edited to make Gemini response times appear quicker. Nvidia Stock Leads Magnificent Seven Among the Magnificent Seven stocks, Nvidia (NVDA) was the top performer, with a scorching 235% year-to-date return through Dec. 15. The AI giant is sharply extended past a new flat base's 505.48 buy point after a Jan. 8 breakout move. Shares briefly reversed lower Friday before climbing 0.3%. Nvidia stock hit more record highs. NVDA is an IBD Leaderboard stock. On Feb. 21, Nvidia beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal fourth quarter and guided higher than views for the current period. On Nov. 28, the company expanded its push into AI, unveiling business intelligence for chatbots, copilots and summarization tools with its enterprise-grade generative AI microservice. NeMo Retriever — a new offering in the Nvidia NeMo family of frameworks and tools for generative AI models — helps organizations enhance their generative AI applications.

On Jan. 24, the electric-vehicle giant said that earnings fell 40% to 71 cents per share while revenue totaled $25.17 billion, up 3.5% vs. the year-ago period. Wall Street expected earnings of 73 cents a share on revenue of $25.62 billion. For 2023, Tesla earnings fell 23% to $3.12 a share while revenue increased 19% to $96.77 billion vs. estimates of $3.05 on sales of $97.5 billion.\n\nDow Jones Stocks In Magnificent 7: Apple, Microsoft Two Dow Jones names among the Magnificent Seven stocks, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) traded lower in the stock market today. Apple stock lost 1% Friday. Shares are below their 50-day line as a flat base shows a 199.62 buy point. In recent weeks, Apple beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter, thanks to iPhone 15 handset sales and services growth. According to MacRumors and other outlets, Apple could have a generative AI feature — internally known as Apple GPT — available on the iPhone and iPad sometime late next year. Meanwhile, Microsoft stock is moving back out of buy range above a flat base's 384.30 buy point. The stock fell 0.4% Friday. On Jan. 30, Microsoft beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal second quarter thanks to strong cloud computing business.\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis"}

RIVN stock was down over 8% intraday on Friday, over and above the 25.60% loss it incurred in the previous session on back of dismal 2024 production guidance.\n\nTesla investor and Future Fund co-founder and Managing Partner Gary Black on Thursday defended the company as one that can potentially become the number two electric-vehicle maker, behind the Elon Musk-led company.\n\nPotential To Be Number 2: Black called upon Tesla investors to root for a strong number-two non-ICE player to help the company to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. The fund manager said Rivian has a high quality product, brand recognition, execution skills, lack of legacy ICE baggage, and competitive conditioning.\n\nRivian can happily co-exist with Tesla to be that strong number-two player by 2030, he said. Rivian’s brand took the top honors in owner satisfaction, based on Consumer Reports’ survey, with 86% of customers saying they would buy it again, he noted.\n\nBlack also said Rivian competes in just pickups and SUVs, the auto industry's two most profitable segments.\n\nGeneral Motors Corp. GM, Ford Motor Co. F, Volkswagen AG VWAGY and BYD Co. Ltd. BYDDY do not have it in them to be that credible number two, the fund manager added.\n\nSee Also: Best Electric Vehicle Stocks\n\nCash Position: The Irvine, California-based EV maker will likely to be gross-margin positive by the fourth quarter, Black said, adding that the company’s cash bleed will drop significantly exiting 2024. He also shrugged off concerns regarding capital adequacy.\n\nThe Irvine, California-based company has never had any trouble raising capital, the fund manager said. He also noted that the company had $9.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, exiting the fourth quarter.\n\nM&A Probability High: Black also flagged the probability of Rivian’s electric delivery van customer Amazon, Inc. AMZN buying Rivian. Even at a 50% premium, Amazon can buy Rivian out for a “rounding error,” he said. He noted that Rivian’s enterprise value would be under $10 billion compared to Amazon’s $1.8 trillion market cap. At the end of 2023, the e-commerce giant had cash and short-term investments of $87 billion, he added.\n\nUpcoming Catalyst: Rivian shares currently traded at 1.5 times 2023 revenue compared to 6.2 times for Tesla, Black said. He also sees the upcoming R2 launch event on March 7 to be a key catalyst.\n\nThe R2 second-gen platform will put Rivian into the $45,000 to $50,000 segments, he added.\n\nBlack is among the analysts who have been calling for Tesla to expedite the launch of the Model 2 next-gen platform EVs, which will likely have a sub-$30,000 price point.\n\nFuture Fund Active ETF FFND, the actively-managed exchange-traded fund floated by Black’s fund, owns 3,700 Tesla shares valued at $730,417, and 20,852 Rivian shares valued at $238,755.\n\nAt last check, shares of Rivian were down 7.9% to $10.54, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga’s Future Of Mobility coverage by following this link.\n\nRelated Link: Tesla CEO Elon Musk Says Rivian Exec Team Needs ‘To Live In The Factory Or They Will Die’\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

A major software update that serves to address a recall is about to kick in, and Cybertruck testing is proving a bit of a mixed bag. That was enough to send Tesla down modestly in the session.\n\nThe latest recall effort to be addressed by the software update focuses on “…unstable rear camera integrated circuit communications owing to software issues.” Such a condition, reports note, may prevent the driver from having access to a full field of vision, which will increase the potential for vehicle collisions and similar safety hazards.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Cybertruck Testing Range\n\nWhile this is going on, the Cybertruck is getting tested with some noteworthy results. One test that featured highway driving didn’t return the results some were hoping for, but a subsequent test that featured both city and highway driving in “favorable weather” produced much better results overall. Other tests suggested mixed-bag performance issues, including surprisingly zippy acceleration and oddly shaped truck beds that might make them a bit less useful than conventional gas-powered pickups.\n\nWhat Is a Fair Price for Tesla Stock?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts have a Hold consensus rating on TSLA stock based on 12 Buys, 17 Holds, and five Sells assigned in the past three months, as indicated by the graphic below. After a 1.3% loss in its share price over the past year, the average TSLA price target of $218.75 per share implies 12.16% upside potential.\n\nDisclosure"}

Instead, electric-vehicle peers’ results and a slowing Chinese car industry loomed over the EV pioneer.\n\nShares of Tesla were down about 0.9% in early trading Friday. The S&P 500 SPX 0.03% and Nasdaq Composite COMP -0.28% were both up about 0.4%.\n\nThrough early trading on Friday, Tesla shares have fallen about 4% for this week. Nvidia shares have risen about 9% for the week, after the chip maker posted strong results Wednesday.\n\nUnlike many other companies, Tesla didn’t get an AI boost from Nvidia’s strong earnings this week as it has in the past.\n\nNvidia stock rose roughly 30% over the week following its fiscal first-quarter results reported in May 2023 —the period that kicked off the AI boom. Tesla stock rose roughly 15% over the same span, while the Nasdaq rose roughly 5%.\n\nNvidia started that run with a market capitalization of about $755 billion. Now it’s worth more than $2 trillion, based on early Friday prices. Tesla’s market cap was about $580 billion back then. Now it’s about $630 billion. Tesla’s market value hasn’t surpassed that of Nvidia since March 2023.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nTesla stock has previously gotten a bump from AI because the car maker uses AI to train its driver-assistance technology. In fact, CEO Elon Musk calls Tesla a robotics and AI company; more widespread AI computing should benefit the company and its shares.\n\nBut other EV companies’ results seem to have taken priority for Tesla investors this week. Guidance for 2024 production from Lucid LCID -1.95% and Rivian Automotive both fell short of Wall Street expectations—stoking fears of slowing growth in EV demand.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Review & Preview Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what's likely to matter tomorrow. Preview Subscribed\n\nRivian is looking to make about 57,000 units in 2024, roughly the same amount as 2023. Wall Street had estimated closer to 66,000 units. Lucid, meanwhile, is planning to make 9,000 vehicles in 2024, up from about 8,400 made in 2023. But Wall Street was looking for closer to 12,000.\n\nLucid and Rivian shares have fallen about 19% and 36%, respectively, over the past five days through early trading Friday.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nChina isn’t helping either. On Thursday, J.P. Morgan analyst Nick Lai downgraded shares of NIO to Sell from Hold, reducing his target for the stock price to $5 a share from $8.50.\n\nPart of the problem is the Chinese auto industry. Chinese passenger vehicle sales were down about 9% year over year during the Lunar New Year holiday, Lai noted.\n\n“We now project passenger vehicle sales or demand will remain under seasonality until April/May,” Lau wrote. He suggests watching the Beijing auto show, which starts in late April, to see if demand starts to pick up.\n\nUnusually low demand would have implications for more than just NIO. Shares of XPeng, Li Auto, and, of course, Tesla, all trade on Chinese automotive data points, as China is the world’s largest market for new EVs.\n\nThe data regarding Tesla, however, looks fine so far. Citi analyst Jeff Chung wrote recently that Tesla’s retail sales in China in January rose about 52% from a year earlier. While that is a strong result, it is hard to draw conclusions from one month of data.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nAfter all the changes in stock pricing and outlooks, Nvidia stock trades for 33 times earnings expected over the coming 12 months, compared with 60 times when it started the run in May 2023, according to FactSet. Nvidia stock is cheaper now. Tesla stock trades for about 61 times, up from about 46 times back in May 2023."}

In both bull and bear markets, regularly checking time-tested stock screens can help you zero in on the top stock picks to buy and watch. Heavily tracked names like Magnificent Seven stocks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN) and others will come on and off these stock lists depending on market conditions.\n\nX\n\nAfter reporting another beat-and-raise quarter, Nvidia stock continues to bask in the glory of its artificial intelligence-driven power. But nothing goes up forever. Just ask Tesla. The EV pioneer continues to struggle while Nvidia, Meta stock and others hold strong.\n\nRegularly checking the names on lists like the IBD 50, IBD Long-Term Leaders and IBD Sector Leaders always provides a good starting point for finding and monitoring potential stock picks. Each day, you can also see which stocks just came on or off these lists.\n\nThis process will help you identify and track stocks such as NVDA, AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA, META, AMZN and MSFT. It also helps you understand the ideal time to buy stocks like Nvidia and Google by using stock charts.\n\nCava, GigaCloud Among IPO Stocks To Watch\n\nTo stay on top of promising younger and new companies, check the IPO Leaders list. Current top IPO stocks include Cava (CAVA), GitLab (GTLB) and Monday.com (MNDY). Cava is scheduled to report earnings this month on Feb. 27. Shares of Cava stock have pulled back this week after soaring from a Feb. 1 breakout.\n\nProfiled in the IBD New America on Feb. 15, GigaCloud Technology (GCT) has also popped onto this screen.\n\nYes, Nvidia Is One. But There Aren't The Mag 7 You Expect.\n\nFind The Best Stock Picks To Buy And Watch — With An Eye On Market Exposure\n\nThe company names will change over time and across fluid stock market cycles. But the traits of winning stocks you look for remain the same.\n\nHere's an effective way to hone your stock picks and zero in on the best stocks to buy and watch. Focus on stocks with exceptional earnings growth that are breaking out of a chart pattern during a strong market uptrend.\n\nFor beginning investors unsure of how to start investing in stocks (or for experienced investors looking to save time), start with this simple three-step routine. One key part of that process is to track suggested market exposure levels to manage risk.\n\nInvestors can think of this three-step approach like a three-legged stool. Stable when all three legs are in place, the stool is unstable when any one element is missing.\n\nMaintaining your list of stocks to buy and watch is an ongoing process. Regularly use lists like IBD Long-Term Leaders, IBD Sector Leaders and IBD 50. And IBD Big Cap 20 and IPO Leaders are also favorites to continually find potential stock picks.\n\nBe sure to also have sound rules for when to sell stocks since even the best stocks eventually falter, especially in a bear market or market correction. The 2020 coronavirus stock market crash and rebound only reinforced that reality. After the bear market in 2022, a strong bull market in 2023 has carried over into this year, further illustrating the need for investors to stay flexible and follow sound rules on how to invest.\n\nStock Picks: 7 Traits Of Winning Stocks\n\nThrough a groundbreaking study of 100-plus years of market history, IBD identified seven common traits of winning stocks, with earnings growth being one of the most critical factors.\n\nDuring their big moves, top performers like GOOGL, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA and NFLX have all shown explosive, even triple-digit, earnings growth as their share prices rose dramatically. Note that after tumbling in the 2022 bear market, these tech titans have all flashed some of these traits — and impressive rebounds.\n\nOne of these seven traits is strong institutional demand. To help zero in on growth stocks flashing that characteristic, check IBD's monthly report on new buys by the best mutual funds. The latest report features stocks like Tesla, Alphabet and Meta stock riding the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nAs you go through a buying checklist to evaluate your potential stock picks, look for companies posting 25% or higher earnings growth.\n\nBe sure to also use IBD Stock Checkup to check your stock's EPS Rating and many other key stock-picking metrics. You'll instantly see if the stock earns a pass or fail grade for both its quarterly and annual earnings growth.\n\nTips On Evaluating Earnings Growth\n\nLook For Growth Stocks Forming Chart Patterns\n\nJust because a company has stellar earnings growth doesn't mean it's a good time to buy its stock. Several other factors come into play, including the stock market trend and the action in the stock chart. You can significantly improve the performance of your stock picks — and reduce your risk — if you make sure the stock chart and the market are giving you the green light to buy.\n\nChart patterns serve as a launchpad for a stock's climb. Also known as bases or consolidations, these patterns form after a stock has already climbed and is now taking a breather to hopefully set up a new run. The ideal time to buy a stock is when it completes that base and proves its strength by punching through a point of resistance in heavy volume.\n\nThe most profitable and common chart patterns to look for are the cup with handle, double bottom and flat base. Once you identify companies with strong earnings that are also forming one of these three patterns, you'll be well on your way to finding the best stocks to buy and watch.\n\nWinning moves from AAPL stock, NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN, NFLX, META and countless others over the years prove this point. Virtually all of the market's biggest winners form one or all three of these patterns as they make their big climbs.\n\nThese chart patterns repeat again and again, year after year.\n\nTips On How To Read Stock Charts\n\nStock Picks: Where To Find The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nTo help streamline your research, IBD provides a collection of time-tested stock lists. These screens are computer generated and based on proven criteria rather than opinions.\n\nThe criteria come from our study of market history in which we identified the common characteristics winning stocks share in the early stages of a big move. With these screens, we highlight today's stocks that are most strongly showing those same telltale traits.\n\nWhile you should never buy a stock just because it's on one of IBD's screens, these lists are an excellent starting point for building a high-quality, actionable watchlist.\n\nBe sure to regularly check IBD Stock Lists Update to see which companies just came on and off IBD's top screens.\n\nTips On Where To Find The Best Stocks\n\nTips On Finding The Best Stocks To Buy And More\n\nFollow Matthew Galgani on Twitter at @IBD_MGalgani.\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhat Makes Meta Magnificent Makes Tesla Terrible\n\nHere's Where Top Fund Managers Are Investing Their Money\n\nMagnificent Seven Stocks: Latest News & Market Cap Weighting\n\nSee Which Stocks Just Came On — And Off — IBD Stock Lists\n\nIdentify Bases And Buy Points With Pattern Recognition From MarketSmith"}

Shares have added about 8.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Tesla due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nTesla Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates\n\nTesla came up with a disappointing fourth-quarter 2023 show, missing both earnings and revenue estimates. Fourth-quarter earnings per share of 71 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents and also declined from the year-ago figure of $1.19. Total revenues of $25.17 billion also lagged the consensus mark of $25.94 billion but inched up 3% year over year.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nTesla’s fourth-quarter production totaled 494,989 units (476,777 Model 3/Y, and 18,212 other models), up 13% year over year, and surpassed our estimate of 481,420 units. The company delivered 484,507 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 20% and topping our estimate of 476,620 units. The Model 3/Y registered deliveries of 461,538 vehicles, marking year-over-year growth of 19% and outpacing our projection by 3,646 units.\n\nTotal automotive revenues of $21,563 million were up 1% year over year but lagged our estimate of $22,385 million. The reported figure also included $433 million from the sale of regulatory credits for electric vehicles, which decreased 7% year over year. Automotive sales, excluding revenues from leasing and regulatory credits, totaled $20,630 million, missing our projection of $21,468 million on lower-than-expected ASPs.\n\nAutomotive gross profit came in at $4,065 million. Automotive gross margin came in at 18.8%, down from 25.9% reported in fourth-quarter 2022 but topping our forecast of 18.4%. This can be attributed to lower-than-expected cost of automotive sales. The metric came in at 17,498 million, below our projection of 18,273 million.Tesla’s operating margin declined 964 basis points year over year to 7.6% in the quarter under discussion and also lagged our estimate of 7.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage revenues came in at $1,438 million in fourth-quarter 2023, higher than the year-ago quarter’s figure of $1,310 million but lagging our estimate of $1,591 million.

The stock cleared the 800 level in early trades Friday. But is Nvidia a buy now?\n\nX\n\nNvidia delivered yet another beat and raise quarter Wednesday. Earnings of $5.16 per share on sales of $22.1 billion beat views of $4.59 earnings per share and $20.4 billion in sales.\n\nEarlier, the company observed that limited supply of AI chips as the biggest challenge to growth. Customers may also wait for the next generation B100 chip that is expected in the coming quarters. On Tuesday, Baird analysts saw this as a good thing. B100 chips will have better performance and will likely have a higher average selling price.\n\nLast week, the AI-chip maker disclosed its recent stakes in several smaller AI plays in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOn Monday last week, shares rose to an all-time high Of 746.11. Chief Executive Jensen Huang gave a rosy outlook for data center spending — a key segment for Nvidia. Does that mean Nvidia stock is a buy now?\n\nAt the World Government Summit in Dubai, Huang said that \"over the course of the next four or five years we'll have $2 trillion worth of data centers that will be powering software around the world, and all of it's going to be accelerated.\"\n\nHuang added that countries can now \"create computing technologies that nobody has to program.\" \"Everybody in the world is now a programmer.\"\n\nNvidia's graphic processing units help accelerate computing in data centers and AI applications. Meanwhile, Melius Research analysts increased their price target to 920 from 750.\n\nShares rallied after Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) reported their quarterly results.\n\nNvidia shares are above a profit zone from a 505.48 entry.\n\nStrong earnings from Meta have buoyed tech stocks, including Nvidia.\n\nCharting Nvidia's Price Targets\n\nIn January, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reportedly had a price target of 700 for the AI leader. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon also finds that company's valuation attractive and has the same price target.\n\nIBD MarketSmith's chart tools show that shares of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stock rose after analysts at KeyBanc raised their price target for the artificial intelligence leader to 740 from 650. Also in January, quarterly reports from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and ASML (ASML) gave chip stocks a boost.\n\nEarlier in January, the leading maker of artificial intelligence chips disclosed at CES new GeForce graphic processors. The chips are designed for AI-enabled laptops and PCs. It also said electric vehicles are using its automated driving system. Li Auto (LI) and other EV makers have selected Nvidia Drive Thor for their fleets.\n\nThe leader in AI chips rallied 239% in 2023 and hit an all-time high 505.48 just before the year ended. Then it topped, the 505.48 buy point of its base in heavy volume on Jan. 8.\n\nNvidia Stock: Third-Quarter Earnings\n\nShares broke out of a double-bottom base just ahead of third-quarter earnings in November.\n\nA week before reporting results, Nvidia announced at the SC23 supercomputing conference in Denver a new artificial intelligence computing platform and an advanced data-center chip. That sent the stock to its all-time high.\n\nDespite a blockbuster quarter, shares fell after the earnings report. The company said profits came in at $4.02 a share. That came on sales of $18.12 billion for the period ended Oct. 29. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $3.37 a share on sales of $16.19 billion.\n\nCompared with the year-ago quarter, Nvidia earnings soared 593%, while sales saw a 206% spike. The period was also the second-straight quarter in which the chip leader reported triple-digit growth in both metrics.\n\nDemand from data centers was the chief reason. Nvidia's data-center sales jumped 279% from the year-earlier period to a record $14.51 billion. Data-center sales also increased 41% from the second quarter.\n\nWhen it filed its earnings report, Nvidia projected sales of $20 billion for the fourth quarter ending in January. That translates to 231% growth from the prior year, and came in ahead of analyst views for $17.96 billion.\n\nNvidia stock analysts now expect 239% growth in per-share earnings to $11.22 for fiscal 2024, which ends this month. After that, Wall Street sees profit growth sharply decelerating to 69% in fiscal 2025.\n\nAI Products Drive Growth\n\nNvidia has earned a reputation for being a trailblazer. The company was an early pioneer in the graphics processors that many say drastically improved computer gaming. Along with gaming, Nvidia chips now are used in such industries as health care, automobiles and robotics.\n\nIn March, generative AI took a leap with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to the company, Nvidia's AI-capable supercomputer paved the way for the \"iPhone moment of AI.\"\n\nThat helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales and four quarters of tapering earnings. But then the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the two most recent quarters.\n\nTop Ratings For Nvidia\n\nNvidia stock shows exceptional technical strength and boasts a best-possible score of 99 on both its Composite Rating and EPS Rating. Its Relative Strength Rating of 98 also shows that it outperforms the vast majority of stocks in the Investor's Business Daily database.\n\nNvidia also is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that led the 2023 stock rally. The other stocks are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN). Some of these tech titans are customers that rely on Nvidia's advanced chips. It is also one of the \"Magnificent Seven of 2024.\"\n\nNvidia stock currently ranks first in the fabless semiconductor group, which holds 16th place among IBD's 197 industry groups. The AI stock frequently appears on the IBD 50, IBD Sector Leaders and Tech Leaders lists. Further, the stock is on IBD Leaderboard.\n\nIn November, Nvidia stock jumped 15% and outperformed the Nasdaq's 10.70% gain. But in December, it finished up 6%, just above the Nasdaq's 5.5% advance for the month.\n\nIs Nvidia A Stock A Buy?\n\nDespite the stock's surge, its Accumulation/Distribution Rating for Nvidia stock is C+. That shows that interest among institutional buyers in the last 13 weeks is weaker.\n\nOverall worldwide AI chip revenue will grow 26% from $53.4 billion in 2023 to $67.1 billion in 2024, according to a recent report from research firm Gartner. That is set to double by 2027 to $119 billion\n\nNvidia stock is not a buy right now. Shares are extended from a buy zone that originated from a flat base's 505.48 entry.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nSee Stocks On The List Of Leaders Near A Buy Point\n\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSmith Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners?

Source: Nasdaq\n\nStill, given the data breakoff point, it is important to note that Tesla’s overall 2023 performance has been promising and that it started its decline in earnest only in the second half of the year and only had its 52-week chart turn red in late January 2024.\n\nThis means that the filings covering Q1 2024 are likely to better reflect institutions’ attitudes in light of TSLA stock’s more recent woes.\n\nTesla stock price chart\n\nTesla’s year-to-date (YTD) price chart hints at the fact that the numerous issues the company has been facing – worker strikes in Scandinavia, Cybertruck battery production issues, and a major slowdown in demand, just to name a few – have finally caught up with the stock of Elon Musk’s EV maker.\n\nTSLA YTD stock price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nSince January 1, TSLA shares are down a full 20.53% with the bulk of the decline taking place in the first month of 2024. Throughout February, Tesla has been trading with significant volatility and even saw some recovery, albeit small enough that the firm is 5.61% in the red in the last 30 days of trading.\n\nTesla’s most recent performance, however, has been somewhat more positive, and the last 5 days of trading saw Tesla shares rise 4.34%, with the latest full trading day – Thursday, February 22 – seeing them close 1.36% in the green at $197.41.\n\nTSLA 1-day stock price chart. Source: Finbold\n\nTSLA 2024 outlook\n\nTesla’s 2024 performance has also, apparently, taken a toll on analyst attitude toward the EV maker and, as of February 23, TSLA stock is overall considered a “hold” with an average price target of $218.75 – which does indicate a degree of persistent bullishness as it constitutes a 10.81% upside compared to the press time price.\n\nAdditionally, experts’ attitudes can better be described as mixed than bearish, as 12 analysts out of the 34 taken into account by TipRanks consider it a “buy.” Tesla’s stock also boasts a high 12-month price target of $345, which was maintained by Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) as recently as February 15.\n\nTSLA analyst rating. Source: TIpRanks\n\nStill, 17 experts are neutral on TSLA shares, and 5 consider selling to be the right call, with one – Gordon Johnson, the founder and CEO of GLJ Research – even forecasting a massive crash to $23.53 in 2024 for Tesla’s stock.\n\nTechnical analysis (TA) is also proving less than favorable for Tesla Inc. in late February. Data retrieved from TradingView on Friday morning demonstrates that TSLA stock is overall rated as “sell,” with oscillators generally being neutral and moving averages hinting that selling is the wiser option by far.\n\nTSLA technicals. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bearish analysis is somewhat less severe when based on the last 24 hours of stock market activity as, with that time frame under consideration, Tesla’s overall rating becomes neutral.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro – trusted and advanced investment platform\n\nDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

But bull runs don't last forever. Eric Krull explains how to protect against the inevitable pullback.\n\nX\n\nNvidia reported an earnings beat for its fiscal fourth quarter, with guidance that exceeded views. Shares of the company were boosted by enterprise demand for its AI-oriented graphics processors.\n\nBut Nvidia's earnings triumph may create worries around whether the stock eventually becomes a victim of its own success, Eric Krull, co-author of \"The Lifecycle Trade,\" tells Investor's Business Daily's \"Investing with IBD\" podcast. \"When there's so much excitement around one stock, you have to be careful and watch out for the big move,\" said Krull.\n\nAudio Version Of Podcast Episode\n\nHolding a stock into earnings can sometimes be risky. Take Palo Alto Networks (PANW) for example. The leading cybersecurity company was looking strong heading into the report, but shares crumbled severely after earnings were released. So to protect his Nvidia shares before earnings, Krull says he hedged his position.\n\n\"If (Nvidia stock) hadn't gotten so much chatter and hadn't been all over the news, I probably would have gone in without any hedging,\" he said. \"But because of what it is and with the expected moves, I did hedge, bought some puts to make sure that I can sleep at night and not worry about what happens.\"\n\nThe company's earnings have added rocket fuel to an already superior stock. Nvidia shares are continuing to rally sharply since breaking out of a flat base on Jan. 6. The GPU specialist holds a position on five separate IBD Lists, including Tech Leaders and IBD 50. Nvidia is ranked No. 1 in the Electronics- Fabless Semiconductor industry group, and has a Composite Rating of 99 according to IBD Research.\n\nThe success of Nvidia stock is lifting the broader tech sector. Chip-industry related companies like systems maker SMCI (SMCI) stock and chip design firm ARM (ARM) stock also saw shares rise in Thursday trade after Nvidia earnings were released.\n\nSetting Everest Rules Against Nvidia Stock And AI Names\n\nWhile one successful stock can lift other adjacent names, a poorly-performing stock can likewise drag down its peers. Late last week, a plunge in SMCI stock contributed to a pullback in AI-related stocks over a period of three days. Nvidia and AMD were sent into the red until Nvidia earnings news broke yesterday.\n\nKrull says he relies on climax indicators and trailing stops like the \"Everest rule\" to protect his gains. \"The Everest rule was designed primarily to try and pick up the signals that (Investor's Business Daily Founder Bill O'Neil) talked about in his books.\" The signals, which track things like how far a stock is from its lows, the length of the run and the trading volume, are meant to help investors determine whether a stock is at a climax top.\n\nEssentially, the Everest rule helps define where to set trailing stops on stocks, and works best on parabolic moves. Check out this week's podcast episode, embedded above, for all the details.\n\nKeeping An Eye On The Exit\n\nWhile generative AI stocks like Nvidia are keeping the market rolling, it's wise to keep an eye on the exit just in case. \"One of the things that I've tracked over the years is how long rallies last, and 80% of them end in 50 trading days or less,\" said Krull. \"You should be expecting starting around now some sort of correction, and some calendar timing comes into play after you've had a very big year.\"\n\nKrull says March and April tend to be popular months for stock selling and are related to U.S. tax filing deadlines. But he also says such corrections are seasonal and therefore, can be planned for. \"If you're on margin, you can get off margin a little bit or you might start to hedge, and that's always a good reason to take (profits in) stocks that have 20% to 30% gains.\"\n\nCheck your signal strength by watching this week's podcast featuring Eric Krull here.\n\nFollow Mike Juang on X at @mikejuangnews and on Threads at @namedvillage\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIBD Live: Follow The Market With Investing Experts\n\nWhy These Election Year Market Indicators And Seasonality Factors Matter More Than The Fed\n\nAuto Equipment Makers Say China Is Leading Self-Driving Car Demand.

It is often the difference between a loss and double-digit gains over a certain time period. The drawback is that timing the market could lead to missing out on gains and habituating emotional trading.\n\nWith this in mind, Tesla’s stock has broken even over one year. While the index rose 24%, TSLA shares are down 0.32%. Year-to-date, TSLA is down 20%. In market cap terms, this means that Tesla (NASDAQ: ) lost $162 billion of value, roughly half that of Toyota (NYSE: NYSE: ).\n\nAlongside Ford Motor (NYSE: ), Tesla was one of the most .\n\nGiven these lackluster returns and market sentiment, can Tesla still be considered a growth stock, or does it have room to rally in the second half of 2024 with the expected interest rate cuts?\n\nReasons for Tesla’s Poor Performance in 2024\n\nIn Tesla’s Q4 2023 earnings, the company reported a 23% downturn in year-over-year gross profits, at $25.1 billion. Total EV revenue at $21.5 billion barely entered the positive zone of 1% growth for the quarter.\n\nMost tellingly, Tesla’s operating margin decreased by 784 basis points for the quarter at 8.2%, indicating a significant reduction in cost-effectiveness and supply chain issues. For comparison, Tesla’s operating margin was 16% in Q4 2022.\n\nRegarding earnings per share (EPS) for the full year (diluted GAAP), TSLA stock tracked 19% growth from $3.62 in 2022 to $4.07 in 2023. In short, Tesla missed both key quarterly earnings estimates, EPS of $0.71 vs expected $0.73 and revenue of $25.167 billion vs expected $25.640 billion.\n\nTesla’s Economies of Scale Problem\n\nFocusing on performant electric vehicles was one of the initial drivers of Tesla’s success. However, that came at the cost of offering the luxury EV category as a base model. The company’s cheapest model is Model 3, which has a $40,380 price tag as of January. This represents a substantial adoption hurdle.\n\nS&P Global Mobility Survey found that 48% of respondents view EV prices as too high for comfort, with 62% waiting for the technology to improve before considering EV purchases. For that to change, the battery cost has to come down, in addition to manufacturing automation.\n\nElon Musk pushed mold vehicle chassis to streamline this process, manifesting in Tesla’s latest offering – Cybertruck. Likewise, Tesla aims to become self-sufficient in mass-producing new batteries. Yet, both Musk and experts believe scaling batteries will be a difficult long-term proposal given the fluctuating supply of rare earth minerals.\n\n“It’s really, really difficult to manufacture at a speed and at scale.” Shirley Meng, University of Chicago, previously working with Tesla-acquired Maxwell battery company.\n\nIn the meantime, Tesla continues to rely on Panasonic and LG Energy Solution, as well as Chinese Ganfeng Lithium and Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited (CATL). According to analysis, as much as 39% of battery materials for Tesla EVs come from China.\n\nRegarding chokepoint reliance, Tesla received the highest rating of 10, per Fronteo’s chokepoint score index. This is not favorable amid contentious US-China relations. Likewise, it gives the USG leverage over the company following Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition.\n\nTesla’s Green Credit Boost, Competition and Recession\n\nChina and the US heavily boosted EV adoption with the so-called green credits. Included in the Inflation Reduction Act, Tesla lost up to $7,500 in green credits for its Model 3 RWD and LR, reduced to $3.750 since January 1, 2024.\n\nThis comes from USG’s intent to prevent battery sourcing from countries like China. At the same time, Tesla was forced to cut prices multiple times to compete in the Chinese market against BYD, Li Auto (NASDAQ: ), NIO, and Xpeng (NYSE: ) Motors.\n\nTesla produced 1,845,985 cars in 2023 compared to 1,369,611 in 2022, representing a 35% year-over-year production growth. Given that the New York Fed forecasts a 61.47% recession probability by January 2025, compared to a long-term average of 14.60%, Tesla’s car sales are likely to be negatively impacted.\n\nTesla’s Long Term Prospect\n\nIt bears noting that Tesla reported a record-high free cash flow of $2 billion in Q4 ‘23, a 45% year-over-year increase. Companies typically stack strong free cash flow ahead of economic contractions (recessions) to power through.\n\nSo far, Tesla’s revenue CAGR for five years is 35.2%, under the 50% that Elon Musk forecasted in early 2021. Equally so, in January 2022, Musk said that he expects growth to be “comfortably above 50%” in 2022. If a recession unfolds this year, the company could fail to deliver this goal for the third consecutive year.\n\nHowever, given Tesla’s dominant EV market position in the US, the long prospect of scaling production and batteries remains in Elon Musk’s favor. Based on 32 analyst inputs pulled by Nasdaq, TSLA stock is a “buy” 12 months ahead. The average TSLA price target is $218.75 vs the current $194.77. The high estimate is $345, while the lowest forecast is $23.53 per share.\n\nDisclaimer: The author does not hold or have a position in any securities discussed in the article.

The stock is rising in midday trading because production achieved a modest year-over-year gain.\n\nBut that doesn’t change the fact that Wall Street’s forecasts for 2024 first-quarter deliveries are coming down. The electric-vehicle company probably won’t deliver a record number of new cars to start the year.\n\nTesla doesn’t report monthly or regional sales numbers. According to Citi analyst Jeff Chung, who tracks data from the China Passenger Car Association, Tesla’s Shanghai plant shipped 71,447 cars in January,\n\nThat number is down 24% from December, but January is always a seasonally slow month in the car business. Overall Chinese sales of so-called new energy vehicles came in at 682,000 units, down 38% from December.\n\nNEV is how China accounts for EV sales. The category includes plug-in hybrids as well as all-battery electric vehicles. BEV sales came in at about 404,000 units, down roughly 46% month over month.\n\nYear-over-year comparisons make a little more sense when looking at the January data. Tesla sales rose about 8% year over year. Overall, NEV sales rose 76% year over year, with BEV sales rising roughly 50%.\n\nThat means Tesla significantly underperformed the Chinese market, though the data only cover one month. The modest year-over-year growth appears to be enough for investors. Tesla stock was up 1.9% in midday trading, while the S&P 500 had fallen 0.1% and Nasdaq Composite had gained 0.2%.\n\nAdvertisement - Scroll to Continue\n\nThe gain in the stock partly reflects the fact that Tesla shares have been badly beaten up to start 2024. Though midday trading, shares were down about 24% so far this year.\n\nLower sales and earnings estimates are part of the reason for that decline. Wall Street believes Tesla will deliver some 480,000 units in the first quarter and report earnings per share of 68 cents. A few weeks ago, those numbers were roughly 495,000 units and 80 cents.\n\nTesla delivered some 485,000 units in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record for the company. It’s looking less likely that Tesla will beat that in the first quarter."}

A recent warning of slower deliveries. Now some on Wall Street believe Tesla no longer deserves to be among the coveted ” Magnificent Seven ,” and are suggesting alternatives that could replace Elon Musk ‘s company. “The Magnificent Seven now looks more like the Magnificent Six as Tesla falls from the crowd,” billionaire investor Leon Cooperman , CEO of the Omega Family Office, said Tuesday on CNBC’s ” Squawk Box .” Tesla has certainly had a tough start in 2024. The electric vehicle stock has tumbled 26% in five weeks. Its latest earnings report missed expectations and included a warning of stagnant vehicle volume growth . In reaction, several analysts slashed their investment ratings and lowered their price targets on the stock. Tesla’s sharp decline also significantly lowered its weighting in the S & P 500, falling to the No. 10 spot. (The equity benchmark is ranked by market capitalization.) Meanwhile, there are now 29 companies that contributed more to S & P 500 earnings than Tesla, according to Strategas Securities. The research firm identified three companies with both market cap weighting and earnings contributions (for the next 12 months) larger than Tesla — Berkshire Hathaway , Broadcom and Eli Lilly . “Berkshire spent last year fliting with the top seven, but Broadcom and Lilly have steadily gained share,” Strategas said in a note. “The net income contribution for [Broadcom] is just a 0.1% difference from its market cap weight which may mean there could be greater multiple expansion.” Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire has historically outperformed the broader market when volatility is high. The conglomerate’s Class B shares have gained more than 10% year to date. Eli Lilly’s quarterly results blew past expectations on Tuesday, benefiting from the strong launch of its new weight loss drug, Zepbound, and higher prices for its blockbuster diabetes treatment, Mounjaro. The stock has soared nearly 20% this year. Broadcom shares doubled last year, helped by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. JPMorgan on Tuesday resumed coverage with an overweight rating, calling Broadcom “a technology infrastructure powerhouse with semiconductor leadership positions in AI.” The Wall Street firm noted that Broadcom is the No. 2 global AI semiconductor supplier with more than $8 billion in estimated revenue for 2024. The stock has gained nearly 10% this year. — CNBC’s Michael Bloom contributed reporting."}

David Butow/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nTesla asks which employee roles are crucial\n\nBloomberg reported Wednesday that performance reviews for some Tesla employees have been canceled, adding that U.S. managers have been asked to make a \"binary\" assessment of roles across the electric vehicle maker.\n\nTesla employs around 140,400 worldwide, with major production facilities in Texas, California, Germany and China.\n\n\"We are constantly looking for what we can do to reduce costs, and the team is constantly going and checking where can we reduce the cost further,\" Tesla's chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, told investors last month.\n\nTesla recorded deliveries of 485,000 over the final three months of last year, but fading demand, a series of price cuts, and costs linked to artificial intelligence projects, and the delayed Cybertruck took big chunks out of its bottom line.\n\nTesla's profit margins, probably the metric most closely tracked by Wall Street analysts, narrowed to 17.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023. That compares with a 23.8% margin over the same period in 2022 and analysts' estimates of around 18.3%.\n\nAnd with Tesla warning that 2024 growth rates in vehicle deliveries would be \"notably lower\" than 2023 levels and Wall Street analysts trimming their revenue forecasts, job cuts are likely inevitable.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nMusk has also made no secret of his longer-term vision for Tesla and its ability to leverage AI technologies.\n\nMusk, who currently owns around 13% of Tesla following a series of major share sales to fund his Twitter purchase in 2022, said last month that he would need to build his AI and robotics vision outside the Tesla structure unless he could acquire at least a 25% voting share.\n\nMusk: AI is the future\n\n\"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control,\" Musk wrote on the X social-media website, formerly Twitter, which he purchased for $44 billion in 2022.\n\n\"Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has argued that Tesla's value is closely linked to the host businesses tied to the sales of its EVs.\n\nChief among those, Jonas said, is Tesla's DoJo supercomputer, which is powered by AI technologies and could add more than $500 million to Tesla's market value \"through a faster adoption rate in Mobility (robotaxis) and Network Services (software as a service).\"\n\nGlobalData, an analytics firm based in London, said Tesla remains one of the top recruiters last year, with AI and cloud-themed hiring offsetting a decline in overall job postings.\n\n\"We believe Tesla could be the biggest AI company in the world around [Full-Self-Driving], autonomous, Dojo, Optimus, robotaxis,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a recent report. The analyst detailed a series of recommendations to revive Tesla's fate following last month's disappointing earnings update.\n\n\"Tesla is going through 'one of these moments,'\" Ives added. \"However, seeing the forest through the trees, this could be the start of the next AI-driven growth phase of the Tesla story.\"\n\nTesla shares were marked 1.3% higher in early afternoon trading Wednesday to change hands at $187.28 each, a move that trims the stock's six-month decline to around 25.5% and values the Austin carmaker at around $575 billion."}

The company introduced its Model S electric car in 2012, a vehicle that boasted features on par with luxury cars in the market but was criticized for lacking basic functionalities such as parking sensors or radar-assisted cruise control, which were expected in its price range. Issues such as door handles that wouldn't extend and aesthetic flaws in materials further damaged the car's reputation.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe challenges Tesla faced were exacerbated by a lack of transparency among its executives, which left Musk uninformed about the severity of the situation. Upon realizing the extent of the issues, Musk responded by firing senior executives, promoting more eager junior staff and bringing in Jerome Guile from Daimler to improve Tesla's repair centers. Musk also redirected staff from various departments to focus on selling cars, highlighting the urgency of converting preorders into purchases to prevent the company's failure.\n\nWith Tesla's financial situation reaching a critical point, having only two weeks of operating cash left, Musk sought assistance from Google co-founder and friend at the time Larry Page. Musk proposed that Google purchase Tesla for $6 billion, with an additional $5 billion for factory expansions, under conditions that included Google not dismantling the company and Musk retaining leadership for eight years or until the production of a third-generation car. Page reportedly verbally agreed to the deal, according to the biography.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Cheddar was acquired for $200 million yielding a return of 370.37% for its investors. This startup aims to replicate and potentially surpass this success.\n\n\n\nAs negotiations with Google were underway, Tesla's circumstances began to improve drastically. A surge in car sales and the resumption of production led to Tesla posting its first quarterly profit of $11 million. This financial turnaround, marked by a significant increase in share price, allowed Tesla to repay its loans and avert bankruptcy. Consequently, Musk ended the discussions with Google, and Tesla has since continued to grow, expanding into markets in Europe, the UK and Australia. Vance wrote, that Musk “no longer needed a savior.\"\n\nWhile Tesla narrowly escaped being acquired by Google, the tech giant continued to pursue its automotive ambitions, focusing on autonomous driving and robotics technologies and developing its pod-car prototype.

It's been ugly for the stock, with shares off about 27%. Soz, you got to look for us here on what we could see-- excuse me, pre-market trading off just about 1.7%, lost over 3% yesterday. It's going to turn it around?\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: I was looking for a really bad pun like Tesla's stock downshifts to neutral. But you don't really shift in a Tesla, right? It's just an electric vehicle. Nonetheless, here are three reasons why Tesla stock is still tanking. Let me fire these off here really.\n\nPerformance for Tesla has just not been good. You look at that last earnings report, earnings have been softer than expected for six straight quarters. So the Street is getting concerned about the company's performance.\n\nNumber two, Wall Street profit estimates on Tesla are actually starting to fall. If you go over to \"Yahoo Finance,\" you click on the Analysis section on the left rail, you can see some of the earnings trends for Tesla over in recent days. Over the past 30 days, 2024 EPS estimates for Tesla have fallen for this year by about $0.72.\n\nNow keep in mind, Tesla shares are still valued about 56 times forward earnings. Not a good scenario when you see earnings estimates declining and your price is still priced for perfection or a growth stock.\n\nAnd then lastly, I have questions about Elon Musk here, the human being. The \"Wall Street Journal\" dropped its second story over the weekend, digging into his potential or reported drug use. Who else is running in his sphere? And I think this has begun to weigh on sentiment around Tesla.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo you have all that. And then, really a nifty chart, I think, is also relevant to the Tesla story here as well. It comes from the folks over at Car Gurus. And you can see the continued downtrend in used Tesla prices for various reasons, whether it is quality concerns or people just don't want these things. They have range anxiety.\n\nWhatever it is, prices for Tesla continue to fall, which I would argue is putting pressure to even-- for Tesla to continue to lower prices on its newer vehicles, which puts pressure on profits and potentially sets it up for a seventh straight disappointing quarter when it reports three months from now.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Well, the other issue, too, is that you have the issue of so many of the rental car companies that are now putting some of their EVs back into the market too. So that hits on the Tesla selling proposition for a brand new one that somebody can say, all right, just for me to test out this EV landscape right now, why don't I just get into a used one for a fraction of the cost?\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: You can pick them on those Toyota hybrids. I know you're big-- you're a big fan. I really got a lot of pushback on my Toyota boring call, but--\n\nBRAD SMITH: I'm just saying they got the Lexus division.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Well, you work from the market. I didn't think it was that much cooler than what Toyota was offering.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Sorry, Taylor."}

Piper Sandler lowering its price target on that stock. SAP, the German software firm, saying it is ditching all Tesla company cars. And the Wall Street Journal reporting that CEO Elon Musk has created a culture of drug-taking with certain members of the board. Pras Subramanian is here with the very latest. That's a lot of headlines, Pras.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, a lot to go through there. But a lot of people are talking about this journal story. A really well sourced article here alleging more drug use than we originally thought with the Elon Musk, a portfolio of different drugs that he's been taking, right? But the big-- the big story here is the board sort of knew about more of these things and didn't-- and didn't investigate these matters further. In fact, in some cases felt pressured to actually take drugs with Musk in order to carry a favor with them.\n\nSo I looked at the story. And I think of it as more of a board sort of not fully competent, not fully out for what shareholders their best interests-- and Josh I got to ask. You've been around the Valley. Like, have you ever heard anything like this before with tech companies?\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Well, I mean, a common-- a common criticism across all kinds of sectors and industries is that CEOs are often too close to the board. That's not, I mean, unusual. Well, you'll hear that about a lot of companies. And so I don't know if you would just ding them on that. I guess the question with this story in particular-- and to emphasize, these are allegations, right? That's all-- that's all what we have.\n\nI mean, certainly, we have seen Elon Musk smoke marijuana with Joe Rogan. He's talked about publicly as a prescription for ketamine. But yeah, to your point, I think the broader story prize is what it means for the board. And are-- they are they as responsible as they should be?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Right. I mean, when this comes on the heels of course, as well of a Delaware court slapping down his pay package and implying that the board was not doing its due diligence and its duty. And I think that drugs are salacious. The drug allegations are salacious and all that. But as we're talking about it, really, it comes to the core of is this a board that has enabled bad, erratic, whatever you want to call it, behavior on the part of Elon Musk? And is that indeed best for shareholders? And obviously, it's a lot easier to ask these questions, Pras, when the stock is down as much as it is down. What, it's down something like 40% from its highs last year. And I think it's down something like 27% thus far this year.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. I mean, a quarter of the value kind of gone in the last month. And the big thing you mentioned is that case, the Delaware case about how the judge there said that the-- the process to determine Musk's pay was, quote, \"deeply flawed.\" The judge said that Chair Robin Denholm was lackadaisical in her approach to oversight with Musk and everything sort of going on with that company. And I think that--\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Or is it also a true prize, just to be needed--\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: --that and correct me if I'm wrong. Tesla investors saw that plan and voted on it, right? And then Musk hit his targets. I mean, we should note that. It's not as though it was under the radar.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, the allegation is that they were not transparent enough when they set the targets and that they were sort of low-hanging fruit for him to hit. Isn't that the sort of what is an issue here?\n\nJOSH LIPTON: That's my point. I mean, I just want to make it clear to the audience. It's not as though this is just on the board. Tesla shareholders saw that plan, approved it, and he did hit his targets. Now, some may-- I know some of them apparently are arguing, well, I didn't have all the information I should have 10 years ago. I mean, a lot of people-- yeah, we can also skip ahead and say I didn't have the information I had 10 years from when I should have. I just want to make it clear to the audience. They did see the plan, correct?\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: It's interesting because these-- these-- these targets are really audacious, right? And somehow he hit them, and he made a lot of money.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: In 2018 people didn't even know if Tesla was going to be around.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right, right.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: I mean, right.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: But it makes you wonder, you know, sort of-- Musk has been sort of, I don't want to say, cagey with the truth but basically kind of audacious about what the goals can be for the company to hit. FSD is one big sort of a factor here. Did he sort of make some promises that weren't necessarily going to be true in order to hit these big, audacious goals? I'm not alleging-- I'm just alleging that, because he really hit some--\n\nIf you're a shareholder and you look at these goals, they're-- they're pretty very, very, very out there. You wouldn't necessarily think they would hit all of them, but they did from a stock price point of view. And then he got the big-- big awards. So what does that make you think about what he says about the company going forward? I'm not-- I'm not sure. But the board should be more on top of these things, I think. And I think you're right, Julie, about that. What are you disclosing about what this-- this package is exactly to the actual shareholders?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Right. And what are the relationships between the board members and Musk himself, you know? It seems like they-- some of them have relationships with his privately-held companies as well. Also as the journal points out, they are unusually well paid versus Board members across corporate America.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Right.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So that's part of it too.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Massive payments. There's one quick thing. I'm kind of curious about this. In the Valley at least, right, you have a lot of people who are on boards, who are executives, who own bits and pieces of other companies, is it-- was it more so the case with Tesla than other tech companies, for instance, like the PayPal mafia and people like that? Like, is that sort of the norm out there in the Valley? I'm not sure.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Well, I'm sure any number of directors probably there is a sense of a kind of live and let live, right? Where you feel like, listen, this guy, when he goes to Burning Man, what he's doing on his own time, you know, as long as it's not affecting the business, maybe they kind of-- the feeling is I'm not going to step in at this point, right? Now this-- this-- this journal article raises a host of new questions. But I think you kind of nailed it. That's sort of what's really being debated here is that relationship.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah, and then long term value for stockholders, right?\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yes, most definitely.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: All right. Thanks, Pras. Appreciate it."}

The selloff shaved about $29.7 billion off the EV giant’s market capitalization, which fell to $568.7 billion.\n\nThat knocked Tesla down to 10th on the list of the highest-valued companies in the S&P 500 SPX, below ninth-ranked Broadcom Inc.

Tesla’s market cap at the end of 2023 was $791.41 billion, according to FactSet data.

The strategy has been driven by a series of price cuts across key markets in the U.S., Europe and China.\n\nThe Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol MAGS, has risen nearly 12% so far this year, while Tesla shares are down nearly 25%. Meta Platforms (META) , whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg was challenged to a cage match last year by Tesla's Elon Musk, is up nearly 40%.\n\nTesla's profit margins, probably the most closely tracked metric by analysts on Wall Street, narrowed to 17.6% over the three months ended in December. That's as a result of the price cuts and, alongside a weaker-than-expected bottom line of 71 cents a share, added more fuel to those betting against the world's biggest EV maker.\n\nPiper Sandler: 'aging product lineup' at Tesla\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter, meanwhile, sees more price cuts ahead thanks to what he calls an \"aging product lineup.\" He also trimmed his 2024 delivery estimate by around 11.5%, to 1.93 million units, following the group's disappointing fourth- quarter earnings, reported last month.\n\nTesla's net income doubled from fourth-quarter 2022 to $7.9 billion, but a good chunk of that was tied to a deferred tax gain of $5.9 billion. Costs linked to artificial-intelligence projects and the delayed Cybertruck pickup-truck launch ate deep into its bottom line.\n\nMore Tesla:\n\nThe group also said that 2024 growth rates, in terms of vehicle deliveries, would be \"notably lower\" than 2023 levels. Wall Street forecasts indicate 2024 revenue growth would likely come in at 10%, indicating a full-year total of around $107 billion.\n\nPotter, meanwhile, lowered his price target on Tesla by $70, to $225 a share, while reiterating his overweight rating. The analyst cited the potential revenue generation from its growing energy business, which he sees contributing around 12% to top line growth in 2025, twice the 6% of last year.\n\nPotter values Tesla's automotive division, excluding its Full-Self-Driving driver-assistance system, at around $135 a share, with the rest of his $225 target tied to Tesla energy.\n\nTesla's energy division, which sells energy-storage and solar-energy systems, saw overall fourth-quarter revenue rise 10% from 2022 levels to around $1.31 billion. The full-year tally was just over $6 billion, a 54% gain from 2022 levels.\n\n\"Tesla is poised to capture 15% to 20% of global stationary battery deployments,\" Potter said.\n\nElon Musk: Tesla is 'between 2 growth waves'\n\nMusk himself told investors last month that Tesla is \"currently between two major growth waves,\" with \"Full-Self-Driving, next-gen vehicle and energy storage\" powering the group's next advance.\n\n\"Our energy-storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%,\" said Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's new chief financial officer, on last month's conference call.\n\n\"This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in 2024,\" he added. \"This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our Mega Factory in Lathrop.\"\n\nTesla shares were marked 4.9% lower in early Monday trading to change hands at $178.65 each, a move that would extend the stock's 2024 decline to around 28%."}

Shares in BYD have also tumbled by about 12% this year, to be fair.\n\nTesla's stock slide has erased about $188 billion from its valuation this year, according to Business Insider's calculations. The stock closed at just under $192, leaving it worth just over $600 billion at the close of trading Friday.\n\nRoth MKM analyst Craig Irwin has deemed Tesla \"egregiously overvalued\" and put a $85 target price on its shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's worth noting that the stock is about where it was this time last year. And even though Tesla's value has more than halved since its peak the shares are still up almost 900% over the past five years.\n\nNevertheless the 2024 wipeout has put Tesla's place in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of high-flying Big Tech stocks at risk. It's now worth considerably less than Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly as well as Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta.\n\nMusk's own wealth is closely tied to his 21% stake in Tesla — and his personal fortune has dropped about $21 billion this year as a result of the EV maker's stock-market struggles, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Before you start feeling too sorry for Musk, though, he's still worth $208 billion.\n\nShareholders have also had to contend with a Wall Street Journal report last month that said that some executives and board members were concerned about Musk's use of substances including LSD, cocaine, and ketamine. He's denied those claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA slightly more youthful Elon Musk at a Tesla launch. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nDelaware pay ruling\n\nTo add insult to injury, a Delaware judge also ruled against Musk's $55 billion Tesla pay package last month.\n\nMusk doesn't get a salary for his work as Tesla's CEO. Instead, his pay is tied to the company's growth.\n\nThe ruling in Delaware could threaten his title as the world's richest person , given that most of his wealth is tied to his equity in Tesla.\n\nSince the ruling, Musk has slammed Delaware as a place to do business and pledged to call a shareholder vote to transfer the EV maker's incorporation to Texas. And one of his other companies, SpaceX, has reportedly filed to relocate its business incorporation to the Lone Star state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nX's advertiser exodus\n\nMusk has also had to contend with issues of his own making at X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter that's seemingly been in a neverending state of crisis since he took control in October 2022.\n\nAdvertisers have started to pull away from the platform in response to Musk doubling down on comments widely perceived as antisemitic and then telling big-name sponsors to get lost (in a slightly more blunt fashion) in November.\n\nAd spending dropped 54% to $1.89 billion in 2023, according to data from Insider Intelligence, leaving X struggling to sell slots to promote trending topics during the Super Bowl. The advertisers left on X are sometimes for AI \"undressing\" apps and dubious crypto services, BI previously reported.\n\nIn what seems like an effort to drum up advertiser interest, Musk this week sent this an X Ads post to his 173 million followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnag more customers with X Ads! @SnaggedDomains captured their target audience by experimenting with their X Ads campaigns, increasing traffic by 534% and form submissions by 1245%.

However, it did raise the valuation of its X holding by 11% last month, Axios reported.\n\nStarlink struggles\n\nA Ukrainian soldier sets up a Starlink satellite terminal in the Chernihiv region. NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nLastly, Musk's SpaceX has been caught up in a row about Russia's claimed use of its Starlink satellite internet terminals.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly claimed that Russian troops are using Starlink in their territory. Musk previously denied the accusations, but Kyiv said this week it was working with SpaceX to disable Russia's access.\n\nSpaceX also had to delay a launch on Tuesday, again delaying its moon-landing efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Houston firm Intuitive Machines beat it to the punch when its uncrewed Odysseus lander successfully landed on the lunar surface, becoming the first commercial spacecraft to do so."}

Now, Rivian founder RJ Scaringe joined the chorus, pinning the fault for his firing of every tenth employee indirectly on Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell.\n\nIn a statement, the CEO sought to assure investors that Wednesday’s announced layoffs combined with flat 2024 sales guidance and billions more in expected losses wasn’t a warning sign demand had peaked. Just the opposite, he emphasized, noting that the EV market remained in its infancy with 1.5 billion combustion engine vehicles on the world’s roads still to be replaced by clean, zero-emission cars like his R1S sport utility vehicle.\n\n“We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short term the challenging macroeconomic conditions,” he said, citing broader headwinds outside his control.\n\nYet the Irvine, Calif.–based automaker almost exclusively depends on customers in the U.S., where equity markets hit new record highs this month amid robust ongoing strength in the labor market and a gross domestic product expanding at a faster pace than anywhere else in the industrialized world. Even Fox News host and former Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow admitted he had trouble finding fault in the data.\n\n‘Historically high interest rates’\n\nSo what exactly are these challenges Scaringe blames then? During the investor call he was more specific.\n\n“Our business is not immune to existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, which has negatively impacted demand,” Scaringe said.\n\nIt’s true that big-ticket items like cars are more sensitive to rates, which are predicted to remain higher for longer to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating. But Rivian caters to a well-heeled crowd of brand-conscious tech enthusiasts that can afford premium-priced vehicles, including his R1T pickup and R1S.\n\nIf you listen more closely, Scaringe revealed some of his customers are simply tired of waiting years in some cases for their car, or their lifestyle requirements may have shifted in the meantime owing to different choices. Incumbents failing to deliver attractive EVs hasn’t helped to raise interest in the sector, either, he added.\n\nUnfortunately for the overall industry, Tesla has soaked up most demand from higher income early adopters in the U.S. market, a group upon which Rivian depends. That’s why its longer-term future hangs on the outcome of the March 7 unveiling of its competitor to Tesla’s Model Y, the new R2 midsize SUV that will spearhead its global expansion. It’s no understatement to say this is a make-or-break model for Rivian.\n\n“There is a lack of choice of highly compelling EV products in that $45,000 to $55,000 price range, recognizing the average price of a new vehicle transaction was around $48,000,” he said. “We remain very bullish on the R2 segment and the R2 product itself.”\n\nAvoiding comparisons\n\nIn a bid to avoid ongoing comparisons with Tesla and whether Rivian can outcompete Musk’s company, Scaringe sought to shift focus to the promise of hypergrowth by framing EVs as a product relevant for the remaining 93% of car buyers who haven’t adopted the technology given considerations like range and charging infrastructure.\n\nMuch like some of Rivian’s customers, investors once dazzled by fantasies of an unimaginably high “total addressable market” do not have the same outlook as they did when they bought into the company’s IPO at the peak of the EV bubble.\n\nScaringe has little choice now but to look for savings, and this is forcing him to take a giant risk. A major event that will determine the company’s performance this year is a massive multi-week shutdown of production at Rivian’s R1 manufacturing plant in Normal, Ill. Scaringe aims to onboard new suppliers and jettison others in an attempt to reduce material costs and boost assembly line speeds.\n\nEven after work is completed, the slog to coordinate the subsequent ramp-up will affect production in the second half as well. As a result, output this year is predicted to stagnate at 57,000 vehicles, after more than doubling in 2023.\n\nIf all goes well, however, the company should exit the year with what he called a “modest” fourth-quarter gross profit. Underlying annual operating losses are forecast to narrow to $2.7 billion from $4 billion last year.\n\nOverall, however, the reality of stagnant sales for a growth stock expected to continue booking heavy losses amid continued executional risk will likely dim investor enthusiasm. Shares are set to open 15% lower on Thursday when trading begins."}

Tech has been the market’s driving theme over the past year, but one stock piling on the gains has been a bit of an anomaly. Boosted by its positioning in the weight loss drugs space, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has been giving the big tech brigade a run for its money. After delivering exceptional returns in 2023, the pharma giant has continued to do so this year (up by 32%), with only Nvidia bettering its year-to-date performance amongst S&P 500 names.\n\nSo, is it time to let the outsider in and turn the Magnificent 7 into the Magnificent 8? That should be considered, says Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani.\n\n“While LLY has traditionally not been discussed as part of the Mag-7 club given it’s not a Tech stock, we believe it is now well-established in the narrative of companies contributing to a major technological development that could have large societal ramifications,” the analyst explained.\n\nBut perhaps rather than becoming the Magnificent 8, the Magnificent 7 should retain the same number of components, with LLY simply taking the place of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). Based on recent actions, it’s clear why.\n\n“We note that recent price action between LLY and TSLA, for example, has been exhibiting a clear rotational preference for LLY as the increasingly favored name between these two mega-cap compounders,” Shibutani said. “It may not be surprising to see this rotation continue, in our view, as mutual-funds continue to right-size their LLY positions.”\n\nHaving only recently (November) received the regulatory go ahead for Zepbound in chronic weight management, LLY is “entering a powerful new product cycle,” while Tesla right now is “between two major growth waves.”\n\nLLY also “screens better” than other mega-cap tech names such as Tesla on several metrics, including valuation and growth, and catalysts. For instance, Tesla is not anticipated to start shipping its next-gen vehicle until the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, LLY is undertaking numerous studies focused on obesity-related outcomes, which might broaden the TAM for GLP1 medications. The first of these, addressing sleep apnea in obese patients, is likely to have a data readout soon, with a primary completion date set for March.\n\nOverall, LLY shares have a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, a show of confidence by Wall Street’s analyst corps.

While startup EV stocks Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) are selling off hard in the early going after their latest quarterly reports, AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) continues to defy gravity after its highly anticipated Q4 results, with the shares leading today's rally on Wall Street.\n\nSitting out today's upside is EV giant Tesla (TSLA), whose market cap now stands at $620.3 billion - down from a peak north of $1 trillion at its highs. Today's remarkably lopsided earnings reactions could add fuel to the fire for those who argue that TSLA should be booted from the elite group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven,\" which also includes Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nWhile it's an informal title, the Magnificent Seven moniker isn't just window dressing. These companies collectively added a staggering $5.1 trillion in total market cap during 2023, and the universe of all U.S.-listed stocks would have advanced by just 12.6% last year without the Magnificent Seven's influence, compared to 23.3% with their returns included.\n\nThat's why debates are starting to flare about Tesla's inclusion in the group, as the Elon Musk-led company has been pressured by a litany of troubles since the start of the year. With Tesla stock now down 22.6% on a YTD basis, here's a look at three mega-cap stocks worthy of replacing the EV maker in the Magnificent Seven.\n\n1. Broadcom Stock\n\nFounded in 1961 and based out of Palo Alto, Calif., Broadcom (AVGO) is a global leader in infrastructure technology, providing a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions for data centers, cloud computing, networking, and wireless communications. It currently commands a massive market cap of $574.2 billion.\n\nAVGO stock is up 15.4% on a YTD basis. Moreover, the stock offers a dividend yield of 1.71%, backed by 13 years of growth.\n\nIn its third-quarter earnings report, Broadcom beat Wall Street's expectations on both the top line and bottom line. Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.3 billion, up 4% from the previous year. Adjusted EPS improved 6% to $11.06, surpassing the consensus estimate of $10.96. Notably, the company's EPS has topped expectations in each of the past five quarters.\n\nFurther, Broadcom is expected to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the booming AI market. It's the second-largest AI chip company by revenue, behind only Nvidia - powered by heavy demand from partners like Google. Plus, its recent acquisition of VMware should bolster AVGO's cloud credentials.\n\nAnalysts have an average rating of “Strong Buy” for AVGO stock, which is already trading above its mean price target of $1,171.43. However, the Street-high target price of $1,550 indicates an upside potential of about 20% from current levels.\n\nOut of 25 analysts covering the stock, 21 have a “Strong Buy” rating and 4 have a “Hold” rating.\n\n2. Netflix Stock\n\nAfter its latest blowout earnings report, streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is next up on our list as a potential new entrant in the “Magnificent Seven” club. Established in 1997, Netflix is a global subscription streaming service, primarily offering original and acquired films and TV shows that are personalized according to the viewer's preferences. Its market cap currently stands at $248.1 billion.\n\nNetflix stock has rallied 19.6% on a YTD basis, easily outperforming the broader equities market.\n\nFor the December quarter, Netflix posted a robust set of numbers, highlighted by a significant jump in the bottom line. While revenues rose by 12.5% from the previous year to $8.8 billion, this pales in comparison to the streamer's earnings growth. EPS shot up from a mere $0.12 in the prior year to $2.11 in the latest quarter, though still fell short of consensus estimates.\n\nHowever, investors overlooked the EPS shortfall, as Netflix shattered subscriber growth expectations by adding 13.1 million members globally during Q4.\n\nWith its laser focus on content and a large dedicated user base, Netflix outshines its upstart streaming competitors, with its shows dominating the ratings charts consistently. Coupled with one of the lowest churn rates in the industry and a strong lineup of shows set for 2024, the company is well-positioned to maintain its dominance in streaming.\n\nAnalysts are largely optimistic about Netflix stock, with a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” and a Street-high target price of $700. This denotes an upside potential of about 19.6% from current levels. Out of 40 analysts covering the stock, 22 have a “Strong Buy” rating, 1 has a “Moderate Buy” rating, 15 have a “Hold” rating, and 2 have a “Strong Sell” rating.\n\n3. Eli Lilly Stock\n\nWe round out our list with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), whose market value has soared as its anti-obesity drugs explode in popularity. Eli Lilly was founded in 1876, and is a pharmaceutical company focused on the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of human and animal health products. With its products selling in 125 countries worldwide, the company's market cap currently stands at a mammoth $708 billion.\n\nEli Lilly stock is up by an impressive 32% on a YTD basis. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 0.7%, and these shareholder payouts have grown consistently for the past nine years.\n\nEli Lilly recently reported its results for the fourth quarter, and delivered solid growth in both revenue and earnings. Revenues rose by 28% from the prior year to $9.3 billion, while EPS grew by 19% to $2.49. Both figures surpassed Wall Street's consensus estimates.\n\nThe drug giant also remains confident that revenues will continue to grow in 2024.

The EV stock has tumbled nearly 25% in five weeks. Its latest earnings report missed expectations and included a warning of stagnant vehicle volume growth . In reaction, several analysts slashed their investment ratings and lowered their price targets on the stock. Wood has been a longtime Tesla bull as the Elon Musk company is her flagship Innovation fund (ARKK )’s second biggest holding. Her conviction is centered around an accelerated shift to EVs as well as Tesla’s artificial intelligence capabilities. “We have been buying Tesla. There is so much negative psychology in the stock right now,” Wood said. “We think electric vehicles are going to continue to gain share and really take over the market in the next five years. And beyond that, robotaxis are going to change the landscape entirely.” TSLA 6M mountain Tesla shares over the past six months. The popular investor said she’s sticking with her call that her EV darling could hit $2,000 in five years, and she added that she is going to update the target. That valuation would translate into a more than $5 trillion market cap for Tesla. Wood is also confident that her other big holdings have more room to go. Some of her biggest holdings, including Coinbase , Roku, UiPath and Block , rallied significantly last year. “Our own stocks, which mostly are not the Magnificent 6 ... they have corrected tremendously. They’re now starting to show earnings momentum and surprises on the upside, not just revenue, but also earnings,” Wood said. “We think they have a long way to catch up.”"}

Tesla once had the EV market almost entirely to itself, but now, it's grappling with a tsunami of competition from EV start-ups and legacy automakers entering the space.\n\nAt the same time, demand from consumers appears to be fading. EVs typically come with a premium price tag, and high interest rates are forcing more consumers to opt for cheaper gas-powered vehicles. Tesla slashed prices by an average of 25% in 2023 to help spur demand, which dented the company's profitability.\n\nTesla stock is down 21% year to date, and most of that decline happened after it reported its official results for full-year 2023. Tesla delivered a record 1.8 million vehicles for the year, but it was an increase of just 38% year over year, which marked the slowest pace of growth since 2020.\n\nContinue reading\n\nSource Fool.com"}
